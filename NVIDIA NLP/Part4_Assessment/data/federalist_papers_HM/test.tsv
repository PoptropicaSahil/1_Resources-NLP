Method of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One Department of Government by Appealing to the People Through a Convention From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 5 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE author of the `` Notes on the State of Virginia , `` quoted in the last paper , has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a constitution , which had been prepared in order to be laid before a convention , expected to be called in 1783 , by the legislature , for the establishment of a constitution for that commonwealth .The plan , like every thing from the same pen , marks a turn of thinking , original , comprehensive , and accurate ; and is the more worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent attachment to republican government and an enlightened view of the dangerous propensities against which it ought to be guarded .One of the precautions which he proposes , and on which he appears ultimately to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power against the invasions of the stronger , is perhaps altogether his own , and as it immediately relates to the subject of our present inquiry , ought not to be overlooked .His proposition is , `` that whenever any two of the three branches of government shall concur in opinion , each by the voices of two thirds of their whole number , that a convention is necessary for altering the constitution , or CORRECTING BREACHES OF IT , a convention shall be called for the purpose .
`` As the people are the only legitimate fountain of power , and it is from them that the constitutional charter , under which the several branches of government hold their power , is derived , it seems strictly consonant to the republican theory , to recur to the same original authority , not only whenever it may be necessary to enlarge , diminish , or new-model the powers of the government , but also whenever any one of the departments may commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others .The several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commission , none of them , it is evident , can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers ; and how are the encroachments of the stronger to be prevented , or the wrongs of the weaker to be redressed , without an appeal to the people themselves , who , as the grantors of the commissions , can alone declare its true meaning , and enforce its observance ? There is certainly great force in this reasoning , and it must be allowed to prove that a constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be marked out and kept open , for certain great and extraordinary occasions .But there appear to be insuperable objections against the proposed recurrence to the people , as a provision in all cases for keeping the several departments of power within their constitutional limits .
In the first place , the provision does not reach the case of a combination of two of the departments against the third .If the legislative authority , which possesses so many means of operating on the motives of the other departments , should be able to gain to its interest either of the others , or even one third of its members , the remaining department could derive no advantage from its remedial provision .I do not dwell , however , on this objection , because it may be thought to be rather against the modification of the principle , than against the principle itself .In the next place , it may be considered as an objection inherent in the principle , that as every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government , frequent appeals would , in a great measure , deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on every thing , and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite stability .If it be true that all governments rest on opinion , it is no less true that the strength of opinion in each individual , and its practical influence on his conduct , depend much on the number which he supposes to have entertained the same opinion .The reason of man , like man himself , is timid and cautious when left alone , and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is associated .
When the examples which fortify opinion are ANCIENT as well as NUMEROUS , they are known to have a double effect .In a nation of philosophers , this consideration ought to be disregarded .A reverence for the laws would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened reason .But a nation of philosophers is as little to be expected as the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato .And in every other nation , the most rational government will not find it a superfluous advantage to have the prejudices of the community on its side .The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by interesting too strongly the public passions , is a still more serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of the whole society .Notwithstanding the success which has attended the revisions of our established forms of government , and which does so much honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America , it must be confessed that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be unnecessarily multiplied .We are to recollect that all the existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord ; of an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders , which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on great national questions ; of a universal ardor for new and opposite forms , produced by a universal resentment and indignation against the ancient government ; and whilst no spirit of party connected with the changes to be made , or the abuses to be reformed , could mingle its leaven in the operation .
The future situations in which we must expect to be usually placed , do not present any equivalent security against the danger which is apprehended .But the greatest objection of all is , that the decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium of the government .We have seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the other departments .The appeals to the people , therefore , would usually be made by the executive and judiciary departments .But whether made by one side or the other , would each side enjoy equal advantages on the trial ? Let us view their different situations .The members of the executive and judiciary departments are few in number , and can be personally known to a small part only of the people .The latter , by the mode of their appointment , as well as by the nature and permanency of it , are too far removed from the people to share much in their prepossessions .The former are generally the objects of jealousy , and their administration is always liable to be discolored and rendered unpopular .The members of the legislative department , on the other hand , are numberous .They are distributed and dwell among the people at large .Their connections of blood , of friendship , and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the most influential part of the society .
The nature of their public trust implies a personal influence among the people , and that they are more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and liberties of the people .With these advantages , it can hardly be supposed that the adverse party would have an equal chance for a favorable issue .But the legislative party would not only be able to plead their cause most successfully with the people .They would probably be constituted themselves the judges .The same influence which had gained them an election into the legislature , would gain them a seat in the convention .If this should not be the case with all , it would probably be the case with many , and pretty certainly with those leading characters , on whom every thing depends in such bodies .The convention , in short , would be composed chiefly of men who had been , who actually were , or who expected to be , members of the department whose conduct was arraigned .They would consequently be parties to the very question to be decided by them .It might , however , sometimes happen , that appeals would be made under circumstances less adverse to the executive and judiciary departments .The usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so sudden , as to admit of no specious coloring .A strong party among themselves might take side with the other branches .
The executive power might be in the hands of a peculiar favorite of the people .In such a posture of things , the public decision might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of the legislative party .But still it could never be expected to turn on the true merits of the question .It would inevitably be connected with the spirit of pre-existing parties , or of parties springing out of the question itself .It would be connected with persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the community .It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in , or opponents of , the measures to which the decision would relate .The PASSIONS , therefore , not the REASON , of the public would sit in judgment .But it is the reason , alone , of the public , that ought to control and regulate the government .The passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government .We found in the last paper , that mere declarations in the written constitution are not sufficient to restrain the several departments within their legal rights .It appears in this , that occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper nor an effectual provision for that purpose .How far the provisions of a different nature contained in the plan above quoted might be adequate , I do not examine .Some of them are unquestionably founded on sound political principles , and all of them are framed with singular ingenuity and precision .
Periodical Appeals to the People Considered From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 5 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : IT MAY be contended , perhaps , that instead of OCCASIONAL appeals to the people , which are liable to the objections urged against them , PERIODICAL appeals are the proper and adequate means of PREVENTING AND CORRECTING INFRACTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION .It will be attended to , that in the examination of these expedients , I confine myself to their aptitude for ENFORCING the Constitution , by keeping the several departments of power within their due bounds , without particularly considering them as provisions for ALTERING the Constitution itself .In the first view , appeals to the people at fixed periods appear to be nearly as ineligible as appeals on particular occasions as they emerge .If the periods be separated by short intervals , the measures to be reviewed and rectified will have been of recent date , and will be connected with all the circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert the result of occasional revisions .If the periods be distant from each other , the same remark will be applicable to all recent measures ; and in proportion as the remoteness of the others may favor a dispassionate review of them , this advantage is inseparable from inconveniences which seem to counterbalance it .In the first place , a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged by the force of present motives .
Is it to be imagined that a legislative assembly , consisting of a hundred or two hundred members , eagerly bent on some favorite object , and breaking through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it , would be arrested in their career , by considerations drawn from a censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance of ten , fifteen , or twenty years ? In the next place , the abuses would often have completed their mischievous effects before the remedial provision would be applied .And in the last place , where this might not be the case , they would be of long standing , would have taken deep root , and would not easily be extirpated .The scheme of revising the constitution , in order to correct recent breaches of it , as well as for other purposes , has been actually tried in one of the States .One of the objects of the Council of Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784 , was , as we have seen , to inquire , `` whether the constitution had been violated , and whether the legislative and executive departments had encroached upon each other. `` This important and novel experiment in politics merits , in several points of view , very particular attention .In some of them it may , perhaps , as a single experiment , made under circumstances somewhat peculiar , be thought to be not absolutely conclusive .
But as applied to the case under consideration , it involves some facts , which I venture to remark , as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the reasoning which I have employed .First .It appears , from the names of the gentlemen who composed the council , that some , at least , of its most active members had also been active and leading characters in the parties which pre-existed in the State .Secondly .It appears that the same active and leading members of the council had been active and influential members of the legislative and executive branches , within the period to be reviewed ; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to be thus brought to the test of the constitution .Two of the members had been vice-presidents of the State , and several other members of the executive council , within the seven preceding years .One of them had been speaker , and a number of others distinguished members , of the legislative assembly within the same period .Thirdly .Every page of their proceedings witnesses the effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their deliberations .Throughout the continuance of the council , it was split into two fixed and violent parties .The fact is acknowledged and lamented by themselves .Had this not been the case , the face of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally satisfactory .In all questions , however unimportant in themselves , or unconnected with each other , the same names stand invariably contrasted on the opposite columns .
Every unbiased observer may infer , without danger of mistake , and at the same time without meaning to reflect on either party , or any individuals of either party , that , unfortunately , PASSION , not REASON , must have presided over their decisions .When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct questions , they inevitably fall into different opinions on some of them .When they are governed by a common passion , their opinions , if they are so to be called , will be the same .Fourthly .It is at least problematical , whether the decisions of this body do not , in several instances , misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments , instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places .Fifthly .I have never understood that the decisions of the council on constitutional questions , whether rightly or erroneously formed , have had any effect in varying the practice founded on legislative constructions .It even appears , if I mistake not , that in one instance the contemporary legislature denied the constructions of the council , and actually prevailed in the contest .This censorial body , therefore , proves at the same time , by its researches , the existence of the disease , and by its example , the inefficacy of the remedy .This conclusion can not be invalidated by alleging that the State in which the experiment was made was at that crisis , and had been for a long time before , violently heated and distracted by the rage of party .
The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments From the New York Packet .Friday , February 8 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : TO WHAT expedient , then , shall we finally resort , for maintaining in practice the necessary partition of power among the several departments , as laid down in the Constitution ? The only answer that can be given is , that as all these exterior provisions are found to be inadequate , the defect must be supplied , by so contriving the interior structure of the government as that its several constituent parts may , by their mutual relations , be the means of keeping each other in their proper places .Without presuming to undertake a full development of this important idea , I will hazard a few general observations , which may perhaps place it in a clearer light , and enable us to form a more correct judgment of the principles and structure of the government planned by the convention .In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government , which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty , it is evident that each department should have a will of its own ; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others .
Were this principle rigorously adhered to , it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive , legislative , and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority , the people , through channels having no communication whatever with one another .Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear .Some difficulties , however , and some additional expense would attend the execution of it .Some deviations , therefore , from the principle must be admitted .In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular , it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle : first , because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members , the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications ; secondly , because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department , must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them .It is equally evident , that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others , for the emoluments annexed to their offices .Were the executive magistrate , or the judges , not independent of the legislature in this particular , their independence in every other would be merely nominal .But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department , consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others .
The provision for defense must in this , as in all other cases , be made commensurate to the danger of attack .Ambition must be made to counteract ambition .The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place .It may be a reflection on human nature , that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government .But what is government itself , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ? If men were angels , no government would be necessary .If angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary .In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men , the great difficulty lies in this : you must first enable the government to control the governed ; and in the next place oblige it to control itself .A dependence on the people is , no doubt , the primary control on the government ; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions .This policy of supplying , by opposite and rival interests , the defect of better motives , might be traced through the whole system of human affairs , private as well as public .We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power , where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights .
These inventions of prudence can not be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State .But it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense .In republican government , the legislative authority necessarily predominates .The remedy for this inconveniency is to divide the legislature into different branches ; and to render them , by different modes of election and different principles of action , as little connected with each other as the nature of their common functions and their common dependence on the society will admit .It may even be necessary to guard against dangerous encroachments by still further precautions .As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided , the weakness of the executive may require , on the other hand , that it should be fortified .An absolute negative on the legislature appears , at first view , to be the natural defense with which the executive magistrate should be armed .But perhaps it would be neither altogether safe nor alone sufficient .On ordinary occasions it might not be exerted with the requisite firmness , and on extraordinary occasions it might be perfidiously abused .May not this defect of an absolute negative be supplied by some qualified connection between this weaker department and the weaker branch of the stronger department , by which the latter may be led to support the constitutional rights of the former , without being too much detached from the rights of its own department ?
If the principles on which these observations are founded be just , as I persuade myself they are , and they be applied as a criterion to the several State constitutions , and to the federal Constitution it will be found that if the latter does not perfectly correspond with them , the former are infinitely less able to bear such a test .There are , moreover , two considerations particularly applicable to the federal system of America , which place that system in a very interesting point of view .First .In a single republic , all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to the administration of a single government ; and the usurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct and separate departments .In the compound republic of America , the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments , and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments .Hence a double security arises to the rights of the people .The different governments will control each other , at the same time that each will be controlled by itself .Second .It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers , but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part .Different interests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens .
If a majority be united by a common interest , the rights of the minority will be insecure .There are but two methods of providing against this evil : the one by creating a will in the community independent of the majority that is , of the society itself ; the other , by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole very improbable , if not impracticable .The first method prevails in all governments possessing an hereditary or self-appointed authority .This , at best , is but a precarious security ; because a power independent of the society may as well espouse the unjust views of the major , as the rightful interests of the minor party , and may possibly be turned against both parties .The second method will be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States .Whilst all authority in it will be derived from and dependent on the society , the society itself will be broken into so many parts , interests , and classes of citizens , that the rights of individuals , or of the minority , will be in little danger from interested combinations of the majority .In a free government the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights .It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests , and in the other in the multiplicity of sects .
The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects ; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended under the same government .This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican government , since it shows that in exact proportion as the territory of the Union may be formed into more circumscribed Confederacies , or States oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated : the best security , under the republican forms , for the rights of every class of citizens , will be diminished : and consequently the stability and independence of some member of the government , the only other security , must be proportionately increased .Justice is the end of government .It is the end of civil society .It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained , or until liberty be lost in the pursuit .In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker , anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature , where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger ; and as , in the latter state , even the stronger individuals are prompted , by the uncertainty of their condition , to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves ; so , in the former state , will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced , by a like motive , to wish for a government which will protect all parties , the weaker as well as the more powerful .
It can be little doubted that if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy and left to itself , the insecurity of rights under the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of factious majorities that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it .In the extended republic of the United States , and among the great variety of interests , parties , and sects which it embraces , a coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place on any other principles than those of justice and the general good ; whilst there being thus less danger to a minor from the will of a major party , there must be less pretext , also , to provide for the security of the former , by introducing into the government a will not dependent on the latter , or , in other words , a will independent of the society itself .It is no less certain than it is important , notwithstanding the contrary opinions which have been entertained , that the larger the society , provided it lie within a practical sphere , the more duly capable it will be of self-government .And happily for the REPUBLICAN CAUSE , the practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent , by a judicious modification and mixture of the FEDERAL PRINCIPLE .
The House of Representatives From the New York Packet .Friday , February 8 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : FROM the more general inquiries pursued in the four last papers , I pass on to a more particular examination of the several parts of the government .I shall begin with the House of Representatives .The first view to be taken of this part of the government relates to the qualifications of the electors and the elected .Those of the former are to be the same with those of the electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures .The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government .It was incumbent on the convention , therefore , to define and establish this right in the Constitution .To have left it open for the occasional regulation of the Congress , would have been improper for the reason just mentioned .To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the States , would have been improper for the same reason ; and for the additional reason that it would have rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the people alone .To have reduced the different qualifications in the different States to one uniform rule , would probably have been as dissatisfactory to some of the States as it would have been difficult to the convention .
The provision made by the convention appears , therefore , to be the best that lay within their option .It must be satisfactory to every State , because it is conformable to the standard already established , or which may be established , by the State itself .It will be safe to the United States , because , being fixed by the State constitutions , it is not alterable by the State governments , and it can not be feared that the people of the States will alter this part of their constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal Constitution .The qualifications of the elected , being less carefully and properly defined by the State constitutions , and being at the same time more susceptible of uniformity , have been very properly considered and regulated by the convention .A representative of the United States must be of the age of twenty-five years ; must have been seven years a citizen of the United States ; must , at the time of his election , be an inhabitant of the State he is to represent ; and , during the time of his service , must be in no office under the United States .Under these reasonable limitations , the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description , whether native or adoptive , whether young or old , and without regard to poverty or wealth , or to any particular profession of religious faith .
The term for which the representatives are to be elected falls under a second view which may be taken of this branch .In order to decide on the propriety of this article , two questions must be considered : first , whether biennial elections will , in this case , be safe ; secondly , whether they be necessary or useful .First .As it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people , so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on , and an intimate sympathy with , the people .Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured .But what particular degree of frequency may be absolutely necessary for the purpose , does not appear to be susceptible of any precise calculation , and must depend on a variety of circumstances with which it may be connected .Let us consult experience , the guide that ought always to be followed whenever it can be found .The scheme of representation , as a substitute for a meeting of the citizens in person , being at most but very imperfectly known to ancient polity , it is in more modern times only that we are to expect instructive examples .And even here , in order to avoid a research too vague and diffusive , it will be proper to confine ourselves to the few examples which are best known , and which bear the greatest analogy to our particular case .
The first to which this character ought to be applied , is the House of Commons in Great Britain .The history of this branch of the English Constitution , anterior to the date of Magna Charta , is too obscure to yield instruction .The very existence of it has been made a question among political antiquaries .The earliest records of subsequent date prove that parliaments were to SIT only every year ; not that they were to be ELECTED every year .And even these annual sessions were left so much at the discretion of the monarch , that , under various pretexts , very long and dangerous intermissions were often contrived by royal ambition .To remedy this grievance , it was provided by a statute in the reign of Charles II . , that the intermissions should not be protracted beyond a period of three years .On the accession of William III. , when a revolution took place in the government , the subject was still more seriously resumed , and it was declared to be among the fundamental rights of the people that parliaments ought to be held FREQUENTLY .By another statute , which passed a few years later in the same reign , the term `` frequently , `` which had alluded to the triennial period settled in the time of Charles II. , is reduced to a precise meaning , it being expressly enacted that a new parliament shall be called within three years after the termination of the former .
The last change , from three to seven years , is well known to have been introduced pretty early in the present century , under on alarm for the Hanoverian succession .From these facts it appears that the greatest frequency of elections which has been deemed necessary in that kingdom , for binding the representatives to their constituents , does not exceed a triennial return of them .And if we may argue from the degree of liberty retained even under septennial elections , and all the other vicious ingredients in the parliamentary constitution , we can not doubt that a reduction of the period from seven to three years , with the other necessary reforms , would so far extend the influence of the people over their representatives as to satisfy us that biennial elections , under the federal system , can not possibly be dangerous to the requisite dependence of the House of Representatives on their constituents .Elections in Ireland , till of late , were regulated entirely by the discretion of the crown , and were seldom repeated , except on the accession of a new prince , or some other contingent event .The parliament which commenced with George II .was continued throughout his whole reign , a period of about thirty-five years .The only dependence of the representatives on the people consisted in the right of the latter to supply occasional vacancies by the election of new members , and in the chance of some event which might produce a general new election .
The ability also of the Irish parliament to maintain the rights of their constituents , so far as the disposition might exist , was extremely shackled by the control of the crown over the subjects of their deliberation .Of late these shackles , if I mistake not , have been broken ; and octennial parliaments have besides been established .What effect may be produced by this partial reform , must be left to further experience .The example of Ireland , from this view of it , can throw but little light on the subject .As far as we can draw any conclusion from it , it must be that if the people of that country have been able under all these disadvantages to retain any liberty whatever , the advantage of biennial elections would secure to them every degree of liberty , which might depend on a due connection between their representatives and themselves .Let us bring our inquiries nearer home .The example of these States , when British colonies , claims particular attention , at the same time that it is so well known as to require little to be said on it .The principle of representation , in one branch of the legislature at least , was established in all of them .But the periods of election were different .They varied from one to seven years .Have we any reason to infer , from the spirit and conduct of the representatives of the people , prior to the Revolution , that biennial elections would have been dangerous to the public liberties ?
The spirit which everywhere displayed itself at the commencement of the struggle , and which vanquished the obstacles to independence , is the best of proofs that a sufficient portion of liberty had been everywhere enjoyed to inspire both a sense of its worth and a zeal for its proper enlargement This remark holds good , as well with regard to the then colonies whose elections were least frequent , as to those whose elections were most frequent Virginia was the colony which stood first in resisting the parliamentary usurpations of Great Britain ; it was the first also in espousing , by public act , the resolution of independence .In Virginia , nevertheless , if I have not been misinformed , elections under the former government were septennial .This particular example is brought into view , not as a proof of any peculiar merit , for the priority in those instances was probably accidental ; and still less of any advantage in SEPTENNIAL elections , for when compared with a greater frequency they are inadmissible ; but merely as a proof , and I conceive it to be a very substantial proof , that the liberties of the people can be in no danger from BIENNIAL elections .The conclusion resulting from these examples will be not a little strengthened by recollecting three circumstances .The first is , that the federal legislature will possess a part only of that supreme legislative authority which is vested completely in the British Parliament ; and which , with a few exceptions , was exercised by the colonial assemblies and the Irish legislature .
The Same Subject Continued ( The House of Representatives ) From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 12 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : I SHALL here , perhaps , be reminded of a current observation , `` that where annual elections end , tyranny begins. `` If it be true , as has often been remarked , that sayings which become proverbial are generally founded in reason , it is not less true , that when once established , they are often applied to cases to which the reason of them does not extend .I need not look for a proof beyond the case before us .What is the reason on which this proverbial observation is founded ? No man will subject himself to the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists between the sun or the seasons , and the period within which human virtue can bear the temptations of power .Happily for mankind , liberty is not , in this respect , confined to any single point of time ; but lies within extremes , which afford sufficient latitude for all the variations which may be required by the various situations and circumstances of civil society .The election of magistrates might be , if it were found expedient , as in some instances it actually has been , daily , weekly , or monthly , as well as annual ; and if circumstances may require a deviation from the rule on one side , why not also on the other side ?
Turning our attention to the periods established among ourselves , for the election of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures , we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance , than in the elections of other civil magistrates .In Connecticut and Rhode Island , the periods are half-yearly .In the other States , South Carolina excepted , they are annual .In South Carolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal government .Here is a difference , as four to one , between the longest and shortest periods ; and yet it would be not easy to show , that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed , or enjoys a greater share of rational liberty , than South Carolina ; or that either the one or the other of these States is distinguished in these respects , and by these causes , from the States whose elections are different from both .In searching for the grounds of this doctrine , I can discover but one , and that is wholly inapplicable to our case .The important distinction so well understood in America , between a Constitution established by the people and unalterable by the government , and a law established by the government and alterable by the government , seems to have been little understood and less observed in any other country .Wherever the supreme power of legislation has resided , has been supposed to reside also a full power to change the form of the government .
Even in Great Britain , where the principles of political and civil liberty have been most discussed , and where we hear most of the rights of the Constitution , it is maintained that the authority of the Parliament is transcendent and uncontrollable , as well with regard to the Constitution , as the ordinary objects of legislative provision .They have accordingly , in several instances , actually changed , by legislative acts , some of the most fundamental articles of the government .They have in particular , on several occasions , changed the period of election ; and , on the last occasion , not only introduced septennial in place of triennial elections , but by the same act , continued themselves in place four years beyond the term for which they were elected by the people .An attention to these dangerous practices has produced a very natural alarm in the votaries of free government , of which frequency of elections is the corner-stone ; and has led them to seek for some security to liberty , against the danger to which it is exposed .Where no Constitution , paramount to the government , either existed or could be obtained , no constitutional security , similar to that established in the United States , was to be attempted .Some other security , therefore , was to be sought for ; and what better security would the case admit , than that of selecting and appealing to some simple and familiar portion of time , as a standard for measuring the danger of innovations , for fixing the national sentiment , and for uniting the patriotic exertions ?
The most simple and familiar portion of time , applicable to the subject was that of a year ; and hence the doctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal , to erect some barrier against the gradual innovations of an unlimited government , that the advance towards tyranny was to be calculated by the distance of departure from the fixed point of annual elections .But what necessity can there be of applying this expedient to a government limited , as the federal government will be , by the authority of a paramount Constitution ? Or who will pretend that the liberties of the people of America will not be more secure under biennial elections , unalterably fixed by such a Constitution , than those of any other nation would be , where elections were annual , or even more frequent , but subject to alterations by the ordinary power of the government ? The second question stated is , whether biennial elections be necessary or useful .The propriety of answering this question in the affirmative will appear from several very obvious considerations .No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate .A part of this knowledge may be acquired by means of information which lie within the compass of men in private as well as public stations .
Another part can only be attained , or at least thoroughly attained , by actual experience in the station which requires the use of it .The period of service , ought , therefore , in all such cases , to bear some proportion to the extent of practical knowledge requisite to the due performance of the service .The period of legislative service established in most of the States for the more numerous branch is , as we have seen , one year .The question then may be put into this simple form : does the period of two years bear no greater proportion to the knowledge requisite for federal legislation than one year does to the knowledge requisite for State legislation ? The very statement of the question , in this form , suggests the answer that ought to be given to it .In a single State , the requisite knowledge relates to the existing laws which are uniform throughout the State , and with which all the citizens are more or less conversant ; and to the general affairs of the State , which lie within a small compass , are not very diversified , and occupy much of the attention and conversation of every class of people .The great theatre of the United States presents a very different scene .The laws are so far from being uniform , that they vary in every State ; whilst the public affairs of the Union are spread throughout a very extensive region , and are extremely diversified by t e local affairs connected with them , and can with difficulty be correctly learnt in any other place than in the central councils to which a knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every part of the empire .
Yet some knowledge of the affairs , and even of the laws , of all the States , ought to be possessed by the members from each of the States .How can foreign trade be properly regulated by uniform laws , without some acquaintance with the commerce , the ports , the usages , and the regulatious of the different States ? How can the trade between the different States be duly regulated , without some knowledge of their relative situations in these and other respects ? How can taxes be judiciously imposed and effectually collected , if they be not accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances relating to these objects in the different States ? How can uniform regulations for the militia be duly provided , without a similar knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the States are distinguished from each other ? These are the principal objects of federal legislation , and suggest most forcibly the extensive information which the representatives ought to acquire .The other interior objects will require a proportional degree of information with regard to them .It is true that all these difficulties will , by degrees , be very much diminished .The most laborious task will be the proper inauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a federal code .Improvements on the first draughts will every year become both easier and fewer .Past transactions of the government will be a ready and accurate source of information to new members .
The affairs of the Union will become more and more objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at large .And the increased intercourse among those of different States will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge of their affairs , as this again will contribute to a general assimilation of their manners and laws .But with all these abatements , the business of federal legislation must continue so far to exceed , both in novelty and difficulty , the legislative business of a single State , as to justify the longer period of service assigned to those who are to transact it .A branch of knowledge which belongs to the acquirements of a federal representative , and which has not been mentioned is that of foreign affairs .In regulating our own commerce he ought to be not only acquainted with the treaties between the United States and other nations , but also with the commercial policy and laws of other nations .He ought not to be altogether ignorant of the law of nations ; for that , as far as it is a proper object of municipal legislation , is submitted to the federal government .And although the House of Representatives is not immediately to participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements , yet from the necessary connection between the several branches of public affairs , those particular branches will frequently deserve attention in the ordinary course of legislation , and will sometimes demand particular legislative sanction and co-operation .
Some portion of this knowledge may , no doubt , be acquired in a man 's closet ; but some of it also can only be derived from the public sources of information ; and all of it will be acquired to best effect by a practical attention to the subject during the period of actual service in the legislature .There are other considerations , of less importance , perhaps , but which are not unworthy of notice .The distance which many of the representatives will be obliged to travel , and the arrangements rendered necessary by that circumstance , might be much more serious objections with fit men to this service , if limited to a single year , than if extended to two years .No argument can be drawn on this subject , from the case of the delegates to the existing Congress .They are elected annually , it is true ; but their re-election is considered by the legislative assemblies almost as a matter of course .The election of the representatives by the people would not be governed by the same principle .A few of the members , as happens in all such assemblies , will possess superior talents ; will , by frequent reelections , become members of long standing ; will be thoroughly masters of the public business , and perhaps not unwilling to avail themselves of those advantages .The greater the proportion of new members , and the less the information of the bulk of the members the more apt will they be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them .
This remark is no less applicable to the relation which will subsist between the House of Representatives and the Senate .It is an inconvenience mingled with the advantages of our frequent elections even in single States , where they are large , and hold but one legislative session in a year , that spurious elections can not be investigated and annulled in time for the decision to have its due effect .If a return can be obtained , no matter by what unlawful means , the irregular member , who takes his seat of course , is sure of holding it a sufficient time to answer his purposes .Hence , a very pernicious encouragement is given to the use of unlawful means , for obtaining irregular returns .Were elections for the federal legislature to be annual , this practice might become a very serious abuse , particularly in the more distant States .Each house is , as it necessarily must be , the judge of the elections , qualifications , and returns of its members ; and whatever improvements may be suggested by experience , for simplifying and accelerating the process in disputed cases , so great a portion of a year would unavoidably elapse , before an illegitimate member could be dispossessed of his seat , that the prospect of such an event would be little check to unfair and illicit means of obtaining a seat .All these considerations taken together warrant us in affirming , that biennial elections will be as useful to the affairs of the public as we have seen that they will be safe to the liberty of the people .
The Apportionment of Members Among the States From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 12 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE next view which I shall take of the House of Representatives relates to the appointment of its members to the several States which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct taxes .It is not contended that the number of people in each State ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion of those who are to represent the people of each State .The establishment of the same rule for the appointment of taxes , will probably be as little contested ; though the rule itself in this case , is by no means founded on the same principle .In the former case , the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of the people , with which it has a natural and universal connection .In the latter , it has reference to the proportion of wealth , of which it is in no case a precise measure , and in ordinary cases a very unfit one .But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the States , it is evidently the least objectionable among the practicable rules , and had too recently obtained the general sanction of America , not to have found a ready preference with the convention .
All this is admitted , it will perhaps be said ; but does it follow , from an admission of numbers for the measure of representation , or of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation , that slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation ? Slaves are considered as property , not as persons .They ought therefore to be comprehended in estimates of taxation which are founded on property , and to be excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of persons .This is the objection , as I understand it , stated in its full force .I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side . `` We subscribe to the doctrine , `` might one of our Southern brethren observe , `` that representation relates more immediately to persons , and taxation more immediately to property , and we join in the application of this distinction to the case of our slaves .But we must deny the fact , that slaves are considered merely as property , and in no respect whatever as persons .The true state of the case is , that they partake of both these qualities : being considered by our laws , in some respects , as persons , and in other respects as property .In being compelled to labor , not for himself , but for a master ; in being vendible by one master to another master ; and in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty and chastised in his body , by the capricious will of another , the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank , and classed with those irrational animals which fall under the legal denomination of property .
In being protected , on the other hand , in his life and in his limbs , against the violence of all others , even the master of his labor and his liberty ; and in being punishable himself for all violence committed against others , the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the society , not as a part of the irrational creation ; as a moral person , not as a mere article of property .The federal Constitution , therefore , decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves , when it views them in the mixed character of persons and of property .This is in fact their true character .It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live ; and it will not be denied , that these are the proper criterion ; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property , that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers ; and it is admitted , that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away , the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants . `` This question may be placed in another light .It is agreed on all sides , that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation , as they are the only proper scale of representation .
Would the convention have been impartial or consistent , if they had rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants , when the shares of representation were to be calculated , and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted ? Could it be reasonably expected , that the Southern States would concur in a system , which considered their slaves in some degree as men , when burdens were to be imposed , but refused to consider them in the same light , when advantages were to be conferred ? Might not some surprise also be expressed , that those who reproach the Southern States with the barbarous policy of considering as property a part of their human brethren , should themselves contend , that the government to which all the States are to be parties , ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely in the unnatural light of property , than the very laws of which they complain ? `` It may be replied , perhaps , that slaves are not included in the estimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them .They neither vote themselves nor increase the votes of their masters .Upon what principle , then , ought they to be taken into the federal estimate of representation ? In rejecting them altogether , the Constitution would , in this respect , have followed the very laws which have been appealed to as the proper guide .
`` This objection is repelled by a single observation .It is a fundamental principle of the proposed Constitution , that as the aggregate number of representatives allotted to the several States is to be determined by a federal rule , founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants , so the right of choosing this allotted number in each State is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants as the State itself may designate .The qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend are not , perhaps , the same in any two States .In some of the States the difference is very material .In every State , a certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the constitution of the State , who will be included in the census by which the federal Constitution apportions the representatives .In this point of view the Southern States might retort the complaint , by insisting that the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of particular States towards their own inhabitants ; and consequently , that the slaves , as inhabitants , should have been admitted into the census according to their full number , in like manner with other inhabitants , who , by the policy of other States , are not admitted to all the rights of citizens .A rigorous adherence , however , to this principle , is waived by those who would be gainers by it .
All that they ask is that equal moderation be shown on the other side .Let the case of the slaves be considered , as it is in truth , a peculiar one .Let the compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted , which regards them as inhabitants , but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants , which regards the SLAVE as divested of two fifths of the MAN . `` After all , may not another ground be taken on which this article of the Constitution will admit of a still more ready defense ? We have hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to persons only , and not at all to property .But is it a just idea ? Government is instituted no less for protection of the property , than of the persons , of individuals .The one as well as the other , therefore , may be considered as represented by those who are charged with the government .Upon this principle it is , that in several of the States , and particularly in the State of New York , one branch of the government is intended more especially to be the guardian of property , and is accordingly elected by that part of the society which is most interested in this object of government .In the federal Constitution , this policy does not prevail .The rights of property are committed into the same hands with the personal rights .
Some attention ought , therefore , to be paid to property in the choice of those hands . `` For another reason , the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the people of each State , ought to bear some proportion to the comparative wealth of the States .States have not , like individuals , an influence over each other , arising from superior advantages of fortune .If the law allows an opulent citizen but a single vote in the choice of his representative , the respect and consequence which he derives from his fortunate situation very frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his choice ; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of property are conveyed into the public representation .A State possesses no such influence over other States .It is not probable that the richest State in the Confederacy will ever influence the choice of a single representative in any other State .Nor will the representatives of the larger and richer States possess any other advantage in the federal legislature , over the representatives of other States , than what may result from their superior number alone .As far , therefore , as their superior wealth and weight may justly entitle them to any advantage , it ought to be secured to them by a superior share of representation .The new Constitution is , in this respect , materially different from the existing Confederation , as well as from that of the United Netherlands , and other similar confederacies .
In each of the latter , the efficacy of the federal resolutions depends on the subsequent and voluntary resolutions of the states composing the union .Hence the states , though possessing an equal vote in the public councils , have an unequal influence , corresponding with the unequal importance of these subsequent and voluntary resolutions .Under the proposed Constitution , the federal acts will take effect without the necessary intervention of the individual States .They will depend merely on the majority of votes in the federal legislature , and consequently each vote , whether proceeding from a larger or smaller State , or a State more or less wealthy or powerful , will have an equal weight and efficacy : in the same manner as the votes individually given in a State legislature , by the representatives of unequal counties or other districts , have each a precise equality of value and effect ; or if there be any difference in the case , it proceeds from the difference in the personal character of the individual representative , rather than from any regard to the extent of the district from which he comes . `` Such is the reasoning which an advocate for the Southern interests might employ on this subject ; and although it may appear to be a little strained in some points , yet , on the whole , I must confess that it fully reconciles me to the scale of representation which the convention have established .
The Total Number of the House of Representatives From the New York Packet .Friday , February 15 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE number of which the House of Representatives is to consist , forms another and a very interesting point of view , under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated .Scarce any article , indeed , in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention , by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed .The charges exhibited against it are , first , that so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests ; secondly , that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents ; thirdly , that they will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people , and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many ; fourthly , that defective as the number will be in the first instance , it will be more and more disproportionate , by the increase of the people , and the obstacles which will prevent a correspondent increase of the representatives .In general it may be remarked on this subject , that no political problem is less susceptible of a precise solution than that which relates to the number most convenient for a representative legislature ; nor is there any point on which the policy of the several States is more at variance , whether we compare their legislative assemblies directly with each other , or consider the proportions which they respectively bear to the number of their constituents .
Passing over the difference between the smallest and largest States , as Delaware , whose most numerous branch consists of twenty-one representatives , and Massachusetts , where it amounts to between three and four hundred , a very considerable difference is observable among States nearly equal in population .The number of representatives in Pennsylvania is not more than one fifth of that in the State last mentioned .New York , whose population is to that of South Carolina as six to five , has little more than one third of the number of representatives .As great a disparity prevails between the States of Georgia and Delaware or Rhode Island .In Pennsylvania , the representatives do not bear a greater proportion to their constituents than of one for every four or five thousand .In Rhode Island , they bear a proportion of at least one for every thousand .And according to the constitution of Georgia , the proportion may be carried to one to every ten electors ; and must unavoidably far exceed the proportion in any of the other States .Another general remark to be made is , that the ratio between the representatives and the people ought not to be the same where the latter are very numerous as where they are very few .Were the representatives in Virginia to be regulated by the standard in Rhode Island , they would , at this time , amount to between four and five hundred ; and twenty or thirty years hence , to a thousand .
On the other hand , the ratio of Pennsylvania , if applied to the State of Delaware , would reduce the representative assembly of the latter to seven or eight members .Nothing can be more fallacious than to found our political calculations on arithmetical principles .Sixty or seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of power than six or seven .But it does not follow that six or seven hundred would be proportionably a better depositary .And if we carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand , the whole reasoning ought to be reversed .The truth is , that in all cases a certain number at least seems to be necessary to secure the benefits of free consultation and discussion , and to guard against too easy a combination for improper purposes ; as , on the other hand , the number ought at most to be kept within a certain limit , in order to avoid the confusion and intemperance of a multitude .In all very numerous assemblies , of whatever character composed , passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason .Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates , every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob .It is necessary also to recollect here the observations which were applied to the case of biennial elections .For the same reason that the limited powers of the Congress , and the control of the State legislatures , justify less frequent elections than the public safely might otherwise require , the members of the Congress need be less numerous than if they possessed the whole power of legislation , and were under no other than the ordinary restraints of other legislative bodies .
With these general ideas in our mind , let us weigh the objections which have been stated against the number of members proposed for the House of Representatives .It is said , in the first place , that so small a number can not be safely trusted with so much power .The number of which this branch of the legislature is to consist , at the outset of the government , will be sixtyfive .Within three years a census is to be taken , when the number may be augmented to one for every thirty thousand inhabitants ; and within every successive period of ten years the census is to be renewed , and augmentations may continue to be made under the above limitation .It will not be thought an extravagant conjecture that the first census will , at the rate of one for every thirty thousand , raise the number of representatives to at least one hundred .Estimating the negroes in the proportion of three fifths , it can scarcely be doubted that the population of the United States will by that time , if it does not already , amount to three millions .At the expiration of twenty-five years , according to the computed rate of increase , the number of representatives will amount to two hundred , and of fifty years , to four hundred .This is a number which , I presume , will put an end to all fears arising from the smallness of the body .
I take for granted here what I shall , in answering the fourth objection , hereafter show , that the number of representatives will be augmented from time to time in the manner provided by the Constitution .On a contrary supposition , I should admit the objection to have very great weight indeed .The true question to be decided then is , whether the smallness of the number , as a temporary regulation , be dangerous to the public liberty ? Whether sixty-five members for a few years , and a hundred or two hundred for a few more , be a safe depositary for a limited and well-guarded power of legislating for the United States ? I must own that I could not give a negative answer to this question , without first obliterating every impression which I have received with regard to the present genius of the people of America , the spirit which actuates the State legislatures , and the principles which are incorporated with the political character of every class of citizens I am unable to conceive that the people of America , in their present temper , or under any circumstances which can speedily happen , will choose , and every second year repeat the choice of , sixty-five or a hundred men who would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of tyranny or treachery .I am unable to conceive that the State legislatures , which must feel so many motives to watch , and which possess so many means of counteracting , the federal legislature , would fail either to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against the liberties of their common constituents .
I am equally unable to conceive that there are at this time , or can be in any short time , in the United States , any sixty-five or a hundred men capable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at large , who would either desire or dare , within the short space of two years , to betray the solemn trust committed to them .What change of circumstances , time , and a fuller population of our country may produce , requires a prophetic spirit to declare , which makes no part of my pretensions .But judging from the circumstances now before us , and from the probable state of them within a moderate period of time , I must pronounce that the liberties of America can not be unsafe in the number of hands proposed by the federal Constitution .From what quarter can the danger proceed ? Are we afraid of foreign gold ? If foreign gold could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to ensnare and betray their constituents , how has it happened that we are at this time a free and independent nation ? The Congress which conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous body than their successors will be ; they were not chosen by , nor responsible to , their fellowcitizens at large ; though appointed from year to year , and recallable at pleasure , they were generally continued for three years , and prior to the ratification of the federal articles , for a still longer term .
They held their consultations always under the veil of secrecy ; they had the sole transaction of our affairs with foreign nations ; through the whole course of the war they had the fate of their country more in their hands than it is to be hoped will ever be the case with our future representatives ; and from the greatness of the prize at stake , and the eagerness of the party which lost it , it may well be supposed that the use of other means than force would not have been scrupled .Yet we know by happy experience that the public trust was not betrayed ; nor has the purity of our public councils in this particular ever suffered , even from the whispers of calumny .Is the danger apprehended from the other branches of the federal government ? But where are the means to be found by the President , or the Senate , or both ? Their emoluments of office , it is to be presumed , will not , and without a previous corruption of the House of Representatives can not , more than suffice for very different purposes ; their private fortunes , as they must allbe American citizens , can not possibly be sources of danger .The only means , then , which they can possess , will be in the dispensation of appointments .Is it here that suspicion rests her charge ? Sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be exhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the Senate .
Now , the fidelity of the other House is to be the victim .The improbability of such a mercenary and perfidious combination of the several members of government , standing on as different foundations as republican principles will well admit , and at the same time accountable to the society over which they are placed , ought alone to quiet this apprehension .But , fortunately , the Constitution has provided a still further safeguard .The members of the Congress are rendered ineligible to any civil offices that may be created , or of which the emoluments may be increased , during the term of their election .No offices therefore can be dealt out to the existing members but such as may become vacant by ordinary casualties : and to suppose that these would be sufficient to purchase the guardians of the people , selected by the people themselves , is to renounce every rule by which events ought to be calculated , and to substitute an indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy , with which all reasoning must be vain .The sincere friends of liberty , who give themselves up to the extravagancies of this passion , are not aware of the injury they do their own cause .As there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust , so there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence .
The Same Subject Continued ( The Total Number of the House of Representatives ) From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 19 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE SECOND charge against the House of Representatives is , that it will be too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests of its constituents .As this objection evidently proceeds from a comparison of the proposed number of representatives with the great extent of the United States , the number of their inhabitants , and the diversity of their interests , without taking into view at the same time the circumstances which will distinguish the Congress from other legislative bodies , the best answer that can be given to it will be a brief explanation of these peculiarities .It is a sound and important principle that the representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and circumstances of his constituents .But this principle can extend no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the authority and care of the representative relate .An ignorance of a variety of minute and particular objects , which do not lie within the compass of legislation , is consistent with every attribute necessary to a due performance of the legislative trust .In determining the extent of information required in the exercise of a particular authority , recourse then must be had to the objects within the purview of that authority .
What are to be the objects of federal legislation ? Those which are of most importance , and which seem most to require local knowledge , are commerce , taxation , and the militia .A proper regulation of commerce requires much information , as has been elsewhere remarked ; but as far as this information relates to the laws and local situation of each individual State , a very few representatives would be very sufficient vehicles of it to the federal councils .Taxation will consist , in a great measure , of duties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce .So far the preceding remark is applicable to this object .As far as it may consist of internal collections , a more diffusive knowledge of the circumstances of the State may be necessary .But will not this also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very few intelligent men , diffusively elected within the State ? Divide the largest State into ten or twelve districts , and it will be found that there will be no peculiar local interests in either , which will not be within the knowledge of the representative of the district .Besides this source of information , the laws of the State , framed by representatives from every part of it , will be almost of themselves a sufficient guide .In every State there have been made , and must continue to be made , regulations on this subject which will , in many cases , leave little more to be done by the federal legislature , than to review the different laws , and reduce them in one general act .
A skillful individual in his closet with all the local codes before him , might compile a law on some subjects of taxation for the whole union , without any aid from oral information , and it may be expected that whenever internal taxes may be necessary , and particularly in cases requiring uniformity throughout the States , the more simple objects will be preferred .To be fully sensible of the facility which will be given to this branch of federal legislation by the assistance of the State codes , we need only suppose for a moment that this or any other State were divided into a number of parts , each having and exercising within itself a power of local legislation .Is it not evident that a degree of local information and preparatory labor would be found in the several volumes of their proceedings , which would very much shorten the labors of the general legislature , and render a much smaller number of members sufficient for it ? The federal councils will derive great advantage from another circumstance .The representatives of each State will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of its laws , and a local knowledge of their respective districts , but will probably in all cases have been members , and may even at the very time be members , of the State legislature , where all the local information and interests of the State are assembled , and from whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into the legislature of the United States .
The observations made on the subject of taxation apply with greater force to the case of the militia .For however different the rules of discipline may be in different States , they are the same throughout each particular State ; and depend on circumstances which can differ but little in different parts of the same State .The attentive reader will discern that the reasoning here used , to prove the sufficiency of a moderate number of representatives , does not in any respect contradict what was urged on another occasion with regard to the extensive information which the representatives ought to possess , and the time that might be necessary for acquiring it .This information , so far as it may relate to local objects , is rendered necessary and difficult , not by a difference of laws and local circumstances within a single State , but of those among different States .Taking each State by itself , its laws are the same , and its interests but little diversified .A few men , therefore , will possess all the knowledge requisite for a proper representation of them .Were the interests and affairs of each individual State perfectly simple and uniform , a knowledge of them in one part would involve a knowledge of them in every other , and the whole State might be competently represented by a single member taken from any part of it .On a comparison of the different States together , we find a great dissimilarity in their laws , and in many other circumstances connected with the objects of federal legislation , with all of which the federal representatives ought to have some acquaintance .
Whilst a few representatives , therefore , from each State , may bring with them a due knowledge of their own State , every representative will have much information to acquire concerning all the other States .The changes of time , as was formerly remarked , on the comparative situation of the different States , will have an assimilating effect .The effect of time on the internal affairs of the States , taken singly , will be just the contrary .At present some of the States are little more than a society of husbandmen .Few of them have made much progress in those branches of industry which give a variety and complexity to the affairs of a nation .These , however , will in all of them be the fruits of a more advanced population , and will require , on the part of each State , a fuller representation .The foresight of the convention has accordingly taken care that the progress of population may be accompanied with a proper increase of the representative branch of the government .The experience of Great Britain , which presents to mankind so many political lessons , both of the monitory and exemplary kind , and which has been frequently consulted in the course of these inquiries , corroborates the result of the reflections which we have just made .The number of inhabitants in the two kingdoms of England and Scotland can not be stated at less than eight millions .
The representatives of these eight millions in the House of Commons amount to five hundred and fifty-eight .Of this number , one ninth are elected by three hundred and sixty-four persons , and one half , by five thousand seven hundred and twenty-three persons .1 It can not be supposed that the half thus elected , and who do not even reside among the people at large , can add any thing either to the security of the people against the government , or to the knowledge of their circumstances and interests in the legislative councils .On the contrary , it is notorious , that they are more frequently the representatives and instruments of the executive magistrate , than the guardians and advocates of the popular rights .They might therefore , with great propriety , be considered as something more than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the nation .We will , however , consider them in this light alone , and will not extend the deduction to a considerable number of others , who do not reside among their constitutents , are very faintly connected with them , and have very little particular knowledge of their affairs .With all these concessions , two hundred and seventy-nine persons only will be the depository of the safety , interest , and happiness of eight millions that is to say , there will be one representative only to maintain the rights and explain the situation OF TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY constitutents , in an assembly exposed to the whole force of executive influence , and extending its authority to every object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in the highest degree diversified and complicated .
The Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the Expense of the Many Considered in Connection with Representation From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 19 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE THIRD charge against the House of Representatives is , that it will be taken from that class of citizens which will have least sympathy with the mass of the people , and be most likely to aim at an ambitious sacrifice of the many to the aggrandizement of the few .Of all the objections which have been framed against the federal Constitution , this is perhaps the most extraordinary .Whilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended oligarchy , the principle of it strikes at the very root of republican government .The aim of every political constitution is , or ought to be , first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern , and most virtue to pursue , the common good of the society ; and in the next place , to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold their public trust .The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government .The means relied on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy are numerous and various .The most effectual one , is such a limitation of the term of appointments as will maintain a proper responsibility to the people .
Let me now ask what circumstance there is in the constitution of the House of Representatives that violates the principles of republican government , or favors the elevation of the few on the ruins of the many ? Let me ask whether every circumstance is not , on the contrary , strictly conformable to these principles , and scrupulously impartial to the rights and pretensions of every class and description of citizens ? Who are to be the electors of the federal representatives ? Not the rich , more than the poor ; not the learned , more than the ignorant ; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names , more than the humble sons of obscurity and unpropitious fortune .The electors are to be the great body of the people of the United States .They are to be the same who exercise the right in every State of electing the corresponding branch of the legislature of the State .Who are to be the objects of popular choice ? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country .No qualification of wealth , of birth , of religious faith , or of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgement or disappoint the inclination of the people .If we consider the situation of the men on whom the free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the representative trust , we shall find it involving every security which can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their constituents .
In the first place , as they will have been distinguished by the preference of their fellow-citizens , we are to presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished also by those qualities which entitle them to it , and which promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their engagements .In the second place , they will enter into the public service under circumstances which can not fail to produce a temporary affection at least to their constituents .There is in every breast a sensibility to marks of honor , of favor , of esteem , and of confidence , which , apart from all considerations of interest , is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns .Ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human nature ; and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too frequent and flagrant , both in public and in private life .But the universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself a proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment .In the third place , those ties which bind the representative to his constituents are strengthened by motives of a more selfish nature .His pride and vanity attach him to a form of government which favors his pretensions and gives him a share in its honors and distinctions .Whatever hopes or projects might be entertained by a few aspiring characters , it must generally happen that a great proportion of the men deriving their advancement from their influence with the people , would have more to hope from a preservation of the favor , than from innovations in the government subversive of the authority of the people .
All these securities , however , would be found very insufficient without the restraint of frequent elections .Hence , in the fourth place , the House of Representatives is so constituted as to support in the members an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people .Before the sentiments impressed on their minds by the mode of their elevation can be effaced by the exercise of power , they will be compelled to anticipate the moment when their power is to cease , when their exercise of it is to be reviewed , and when they must descend to the level from which they were raised ; there forever to remain unless a faithful discharge of their trust shall have established their title to a renewal of it .I will add , as a fifth circumstance in the situation of the House of Representatives , restraining them from oppressive measures , that they can make no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and their friends , as well as on the great mass of the society .This has always been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and the people together .It creates between them that communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments , of which few governments have furnished examples ; but without which every government degenerates into tyranny .If it be asked , what is to restrain the House of Representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society ?
I answer : the genius of the whole system ; the nature of just and constitutional laws ; and above all , the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of America , a spirit which nourishes freedom , and in return is nourished by it .If this spirit shall ever be so far debased as to tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature , as well as on the people , the people will be prepared to tolerate any thing but liberty .Such will be the relation between the House of Representatives and their constituents .Duty , gratitude , interest , ambition itself , are the chords by which they will be bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people .It is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the caprice and wickedness of man .But are they not all that government will admit , and that human prudence can devise ? Are they not the genuine and the characteristic means by which republican government provides for the liberty and happiness of the people ? Are they not the identical means on which every State government in the Union relies for the attainment of these important ends ? What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper has combated ? What are we to say to the men who profess the most flaming zeal for republican government , yet boldly impeach the fundamental principle of it ; who pretend to be champions for the right and the capacity of the people to choose their own rulers , yet maintain that they will prefer those only who will immediately and infallibly betray the trust committed to them ?
Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen the mode prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of representatives , he could suppose nothing less than that some unreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right of suffrage ; or that the right of eligibility was limited to persons of particular families or fortunes ; or at least that the mode prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or other , very grossly departed from .We have seen how far such a supposition would err , as to the two first points .Nor would it , in fact , be less erroneous as to the last .The only difference discoverable between the two cases is , that each representative of the United States will be elected by five or six thousand citizens ; whilst in the individual States , the election of a representative is left to about as many hundreds .Will it be pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an attachment to the State governments , and an abhorrence to the federal government ? If this be the point on which the objection turns , it deserves to be examined .Is it supported by REASON ? This can not be said , without maintaining that five or six thousand citizens are less capable of choosing a fit representative , or more liable to be corrupted by an unfit one , than five or six hundred .
Reason , on the contrary , assures us , that as in so great a number a fit representative would be most likely to be found , so the choice would be less likely to be diverted from him by the intrigues of the ambitious or the ambitious or the bribes of the rich .Is the CONSEQUENCE from this doctrine admissible ? If we say that five or six hundred citizens are as many as can jointly exercise their right of suffrage , must we not deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public servants , in every instance where the administration of the government does not require as many of them as will amount to one for that number of citizens ? Is the doctrine warranted by FACTS ? It was shown in the last paper , that the real representation in the British House of Commons very little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand inhabitants .Besides a variety of powerful causes not existing here , and which favor in that country the pretensions of rank and wealth , no person is eligible as a representative of a county , unless he possess real estate of the clear value of six hundred pounds sterling per year ; nor of a city or borough , unless he possess a like estate of half that annual value .To this qualification on the part of the county representatives is added another on the part of the county electors , which restrains the right of suffrage to persons having a freehold estate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds sterling , according to the present rate of money .
Notwithstanding these unfavorable circumstances , and notwithstanding some very unequal laws in the British code , it can not be said that the representatives of the nation have elevated the few on the ruins of the many .But we need not resort to foreign experience on this subject .Our own is explicit and decisive .The districts in New Hampshire in which the senators are chosen immediately by the people , are nearly as large as will be necessary for her representatives in the Congress .Those of Massachusetts are larger than will be necessary for that purpose ; and those of New York still more so .In the last State the members of Assembly for the cities and counties of New York and Albany are elected by very nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a representative in the Congress , calculating on the number of sixty-five representatives only .It makes no difference that in these senatorial districts and counties a number of representatives are voted for by each elector at the same time .If the same electors at the same time are capable of choosing four or five representatives , they can not be incapable of choosing one .Pennsylvania is an additional example .Some of her counties , which elect her State representatives , are almost as large as her districts will be by which her federal representatives will be elected .The city of Philadelphia is supposed to contain between fifty and sixty thousand souls .
It will therefore form nearly two districts for the choice of federal representatives .It forms , however , but one county , in which every elector votes for each of its representatives in the State legislature .And what may appear to be still more directly to our purpose , the whole city actually elects a SINGLE MEMBER for the executive council .This is the case in all the other counties of the State .Are not these facts the most satisfactory proofs of the fallacy which has been employed against the branch of the federal government under consideration ? Has it appeared on trial that the senators of New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and New York , or the executive council of Pennsylvania , or the members of the Assembly in the two last States , have betrayed any peculiar disposition to sacrifice the many to the few , or are in any respect less worthy of their places than the representatives and magistrates appointed in other States by very small divisions of the people ? But there are cases of a stronger complexion than any which I have yet quoted .One branch of the legislature of Connecticut is so constituted that each member of it is elected by the whole State .So is the governor of that State , of Massachusetts , and of this State , and the president of New Hampshire .I leave every man to decide whether the result of any one of these experiments can be said to countenance a suspicion , that a diffusive mode of choosing representatives of the people tends to elevate traitors and to undermine the public liberty .
The Senate For the Independent Journal .To the People of the State of New York : HAVING examined the constitution of the House of Representatives , and answered such of the objections against it as seemed to merit notice , I enter next on the examination of the Senate .The heads into which this member of the government may be considered are : I .The qualification of senators ; II .The appointment of them by the State legislatures ; III .The equality of representation in the Senate ; IV .The number of senators , and the term for which they are to be elected ; V. The powers vested in the Senate .I .The qualifications proposed for senators , as distinguished from those of representatives , consist in a more advanced age and a longer period of citizenship .A senator must be thirty years of age at least ; as a representative must be twenty-five .And the former must have been a citizen nine years ; as seven years are required for the latter .The propriety of these distinctions is explained by the nature of the senatorial trust , which , requiring greater extent of information and stability of character , requires at the same time that the senator should have reached a period of life most likely to supply these advantages ; and which , participating immediately in transactions with foreign nations , ought to be exercised by none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions and habits incident to foreign birth and education .
The term of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusion of adopted citizens , whose merits and talents may claim a share in the public confidence , and an indiscriminate and hasty admission of them , which might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils .II .It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the State legislatures .Among the various modes which might have been devised for constituting this branch of the government , that which has been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial with the public opinion .It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment , and of giving to the State governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the authority of the former , and may form a convenient link between the two systems .III .The equality of representation in the Senate is another point , which , being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States , does not call for much discussion .If indeed it be right , that among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation , every district ought to have a PROPORTIONAL share in the government , and that among independent and sovereign States , bound together by a simple league , the parties , however unequal in size , ought to have an EQUAL share in the common councils , it does not appear to be without some reason that in a compound republic , partaking both of the national and federal character , the government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal representation .
But it is superfluous to try , by the standard of theory , a part of the Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the result , not of theory , but `` of a spirit of amity , and that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable . '' A common government , with powers equal to its objects , is called for by the voice , and still more loudly by the political situation , of America .A government founded on principles more consonant to the wishes of the larger States , is not likely to be obtained from the smaller States .The only option , then , for the former , lies between the proposed government and a government still more objectionable .Under this alternative , the advice of prudence must be to embrace the lesser evil ; and , instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue , to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice .In this spirit it may be remarked , that the equal vote allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual States , and an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty .So far the equality ought to be no less acceptable to the large than to the small States ; since they are not less solicitous to guard , by every possible expedient , against an improper consolidation of the States into one simple republic .
Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of the Senate is , the additional impediment it must prove against improper acts of legislation .No law or resolution can now be passed without the concurrence , first , of a majority of the people , and then , of a majority of the States .It must be acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as beneficial ; and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of the smaller States , would be more rational , if any interests common to them , and distinct from those of the other States , would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger .But as the larger States will always be able , by their power over the supplies , to defeat unreasonable exertions of this prerogative of the lesser States , and as the faculty and excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments are most liable , it is not impossible that this part of the Constitution may be more convenient in practice than it appears to many in contemplation .IV .The number of senators , and the duration of their appointment , come next to be considered .In order to form an accurate judgment on both of these points , it will be proper to inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a senate ; and in order to ascertain these , it will be necessary to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer from the want of such an institution .
First .It is a misfortune incident to republican government , though in a less degree than to other governments , that those who administer it may forget their obligations to their constituents , and prove unfaithful to their important trust .In this point of view , a senate , as a second branch of the legislative assembly , distinct from , and dividing the power with , a first , must be in all cases a salutary check on the government .It doubles the security to the people , by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy , where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient .This is a precaution founded on such clear principles , and now so well understood in the United States , that it would be more than superfluous to enlarge on it .I will barely remark , that as the improbability of sinister combinations will be in proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies , it must be politic to distinguish them from each other by every circumstance which will consist with a due harmony in all proper measures , and with the genuine principles of republican government .Secondly .The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions , and to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions .
Examples on this subject might be cited without number ; and from proceedings within the United States , as well as from the history of other nations .But a position that will not be contradicted , need not be proved .All that need be remarked is , that a body which is to correct this infirmity ought itself to be free from it , and consequently ought to be less numerous .It ought , moreover , to possess great firmness , and consequently ought to hold its authority by a tenure of considerable duration .Thirdly .Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation .It is not possible that an assembly of men called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature , continued in appointment for a short time , and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study of the laws , the affairs , and the comprehensive interests of their country , should , if left wholly to themselves , escape a variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative trust .It may be affirmed , on the best grounds , that no small share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of our governments ; and that these have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them .
What indeed are all the repealing , explaining , and amending laws , which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes , but so many monuments of deficient wisdom ; so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding session ; so many admonitions to the people , of the value of those aids which may be expected from a well-constituted senate ? A good government implies two things : first , fidelity to the object of government , which is the happiness of the people ; secondly , a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained .Some governments are deficient in both these qualities ; most governments are deficient in the first .I scruple not to assert , that in American governments too little attention has been paid to the last .The federal Constitution avoids this error ; and what merits particular notice , it provides for the last in a mode which increases the security for the first .Fourthly .The mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid succession of new members , however qualified they may be , points out , in the strongest manner , the necessity of some stable institution in the government .Every new election in the States is found to change one half of the representatives .From this change of men must proceed a change of opinions ; and from a change of opinions , a change of measures .
But a continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success .The remark is verified in private life , and becomes more just , as well as more important , in national transactions .To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government would fill a volume .I will hint a few only , each of which will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others .In the first place , it forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations , and all the advantages connected with national character .An individual who is observed to be inconstant to his plans , or perhaps to carry on his affairs without any plan at all , is marked at once , by all prudent people , as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly .His more friendly neighbors may pity him , but all will decline to connect their fortunes with his ; and not a few will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of his .One nation is to another what one individual is to another ; with this melancholy distinction perhaps , that the former , with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter , are under fewer restraints also from taking undue advantage from the indiscretions of each other .Every nation , consequently , whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability , may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of their wiser neighbors .
But the best instruction on this subject is unhappily conveyed to America by the example of her own situation .She finds that she is held in no respect by her friends ; that she is the derision of her enemies ; and that she is a prey to every nation which has an interest in speculating on her fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs .The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more calamitous .It poisons the blessing of liberty itself .It will be of little avail to the people , that the laws are made by men of their own choice , if the laws be so voluminous that they can not be read , or so incoherent that they can not be understood ; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated , or undergo such incessant changes that no man , who knows what the law is to-day , can guess what it will be to-morrow .Law is defined to be a rule of action ; but how can that be a rule , which is little known , and less fixed ? Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable advantage it gives to the sagacious , the enterprising , and the moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of the people .Every new regulation concerning commerce or revenue , or in any way affecting the value of the different species of property , presents a new harvest to those who watch the change , and can trace its consequences ; a harvest , reared not by themselves , but by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow-citizens .
This is a state of things in which it may be said with some truth that laws are made for the FEW , not for the MANY .In another point of view , great injury results from an unstable government .The want of confidence in the public councils damps every useful undertaking , the success and profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing arrangements .What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed ? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the encouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment , when he can have no assurance that his preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim to an inconstant government ? In a word , no great improvement or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the auspices of a steady system of national policy .But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the people , towards a political system which betrays so many marks of infirmity , and disappoints so many of their flattering hopes .No government , any more than an individual , will long be respected without being truly respectable ; nor be truly respectable , without possessing a certain portion of order and stability .FEDERALIST .
No .63 The Senate Continued For the Independent Journal .To the People of the State of New York : A FIFTH desideratum , illustrating the utility of a senate , is the want of a due sense of national character .Without a select and stable member of the government , the esteem of foreign powers will not only be forfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy , proceeding from the causes already mentioned , but the national councils will not possess that sensibility to the opinion of the world , which is perhaps not less necessary in order to merit , than it is to obtain , its respect and confidence .An attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every government for two reasons : the one is , that , independently of the merits of any particular plan or measure , it is desirable , on various accounts , that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of a wise and honorable policy ; the second is , that in doubtful cases , particularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong passion or momentary interest , the presumed or known opinion of the impartial world may be the best guide that can be followed .What has not America lost by her want of character with foreign nations ; and how many errors and follies would she not have avoided , if the justice and propriety of her measures had , in every instance , been previously tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind ?
Yet however requisite a sense of national character may be , it is evident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous and changeable body .It can only be found in a number so small that a sensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be the portion of each individual ; or in an assembly so durably invested with public trust , that the pride and consequence of its members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the community .The half-yearly representatives of Rhode Island would probably have been little affected in their deliberations on the iniquitous measures of that State , by arguments drawn from the light in which such measures would be viewed by foreign nations , or even by the sister States ; whilst it can scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence of a select and stable body had been necessary , a regard to national character alone would have prevented the calamities under which that misguided people is now laboring .I add , as a SIXTH defect the want , in some important cases , of a due responsibility in the government to the people , arising from that frequency of elections which in other cases produces this responsibility .This remark will , perhaps , appear not only new , but paradoxical .It must nevertheless be acknowledged , when explained , to be as undeniable as it is important .
Responsibility , in order to be reasonable , must be limited to objects within the power of the responsible party , and in order to be effectual , must relate to operations of that power , of which a ready and proper judgment can be formed by the constituents .The objects of government may be divided into two general classes : the one depending on measures which have singly an immediate and sensible operation ; the other depending on a succession of well-chosen and well-connected measures , which have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation .The importance of the latter description to the collective and permanent welfare of every country , needs no explanation .And yet it is evident that an assembly elected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more than one or two links in a chain of measures , on which the general welfare may essentially depend , ought not to be answerable for the final result , any more than a steward or tenant , engaged for one year , could be justly made to answer for places or improvements which could not be accomplished in less than half a dozen years .Nor is it possible for the people to estimate the SHARE of influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years .It is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal responsibility in the members of a NUMEROUS body , for such acts of the body as have an immediate , detached , and palpable operation on its constituents .
The proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in the legislative department , which , having sufficient permanency to provide for such objects as require a continued attention , and a train of measures , may be justly and effectually answerable for the attainment of those objects .Thus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the necessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the representatives of the people .To a people as little blinded by prejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address , I shall not scruple to add , that such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions .As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought , in all governments , and actually will , in all free governments , ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers ; so there are particular moments in public affairs when the people , stimulated by some irregular passion , or some illicit advantage , or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men , may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn .In these critical moments , how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens , in order to check the misguided career , and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves , until reason , justice , and truth can regain their authority over the public mind ?
What bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have often escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard against the tyranny of their own passions ? Popular liberty might then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens the hemlock on one day and statues on the next .It may be suggested , that a people spread over an extensive region can not , like the crowded inhabitants of a small district , be subject to the infection of violent passions , or to the danger of combining in pursuit of unjust measures .I am far from denying that this is a distinction of peculiar importance .I have , on the contrary , endeavored in a former paper to show , that it is one of the principal recommendations of a confederated republic .At the same time , this advantage ought not to be considered as superseding the use of auxiliary precautions .It may even be remarked , that the same extended situation , which will exempt the people of America from some of the dangers incident to lesser republics , will expose them to the inconveniency of remaining for a longer time under the influence of those misrepresentations which the combined industry of interested men may succeed in distributing among them .It adds no small weight to all these considerations , to recollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate .
Sparta , Rome , and Carthage are , in fact , the only states to whom that character can be applied .In each of the two first there was a senate for life .The constitution of the senate in the last is less known .Circumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others .It is at least certain , that it had some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations ; and that a smaller council , drawn out of the senate , was appointed not only for life , but filled up vacancies itself .These examples , though as unfit for the imitation , as they are repugnant to the genius , of America , are , notwithstanding , when compared with the fugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics , very instructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend stability with liberty .I am not unaware of the circumstances which distinguish the American from other popular governments , as well ancient as modern ; and which render extreme circumspection necessary , in reasoning from the one case to the other .But after allowing due weight to this consideration , it may still be maintained , that there are many points of similitude which render these examples not unworthy of our attention .Many of the defects , as we have seen , which can only be supplied by a senatorial institution , are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by the people , and to the people themselves .
There are others peculiar to the former , which require the control of such an institution .The people can never wilfully betray their own interests ; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people ; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men , than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act .The difference most relied on , between the American and other republics , consists in the principle of representation ; which is the pivot on which the former move , and which is supposed to have been unknown to the latter , or at least to the ancient part of them .The use which has been made of this difference , in reasonings contained in former papers , will have shown that I am disposed neither to deny its existence nor to undervalue its importance .I feel the less restraint , therefore , in observing , that the position concerning the ignorance of the ancient governments on the subject of representation , is by no means precisely true in the latitude commonly given to it .Without entering into a disquisition which here would be misplaced , I will refer to a few known facts , in support of what I advance .In the most pure democracies of Greece , many of the executive functions were performed , not by the people themselves , but by officers elected by the people , and REPRESENTING the people in their EXECUTIVE capacity .
Prior to the reform of Solon , Athens was governed by nine Archons , annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE .The degree of power delegated to them seems to be left in great obscurity .Subsequent to that period , we find an assembly , first of four , and afterwards of six hundred members , annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE ; and PARTIALLY representing them in their LEGISLATIVE capacity , since they were not only associated with the people in the function of making laws , but had the exclusive right of originating legislative propositions to the people .The senate of Carthage , also , whatever might be its power , or the duration of its appointment , appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the people .Similar instances might be traced in most , if not all the popular governments of antiquity .Lastly , in Sparta we meet with the Ephori , and in Rome with the Tribunes ; two bodies , small indeed in numbers , but annually ELECTED BY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE , and considered as the REPRESENTATIVES of the people , almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY capacity .The Cosmi of Crete were also annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE , and have been considered by some authors as an institution analogous to those of Sparta and Rome , with this difference only , that in the election of that representative body the right of suffrage was communicated to a part only of the people .
From these facts , to which many others might be added , it is clear that the principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients nor wholly overlooked in their political constitutions .The true distinction between these and the American governments , lies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PEOPLE , IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY , from any share in the LATTER , and not in the TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE from the administration of the FORMER .The distinction , however , thus qualified , must be admitted to leave a most advantageous superiority in favor of the United States .But to insure to this advantage its full effect , we must be careful not to separate it from the other advantage , of an extensive territory .For it can not be believed , that any form of representative government could have succeeded within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of Greece .In answer to all these arguments , suggested by reason , illustrated by examples , and enforced by our own experience , the jealous adversary of the Constitution will probably content himself with repeating , that a senate appointed not immediately by the people , and for the term of six years , must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government , and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy .To this general answer , the general reply ought to be sufficient , that liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as by the abuses of power ; that there are numerous instances of the former as well as of the latter ; and that the former , rather than the latter , are apparently most to be apprehended by the United States .
But a more particular reply may be given .Before such a revolution can be effected , the Senate , it is to be observed , must in the first place corrupt itself ; must next corrupt the State legislatures ; must then corrupt the House of Representatives ; and must finally corrupt the people at large .It is evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of tyranny .Without corrupting the State legislatures , it can not prosecute the attempt , because the periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole body .Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success on the House of Representatives , the opposition of that coequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt ; and without corrupting the people themselves , a succession of new representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine order .Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the proposed Senate can , by any possible means within the compass of human address , arrive at the object of a lawless ambition , through all these obstructions ? If reason condemns the suspicion , the same sentence is pronounced by experience .The constitution of Maryland furnishes the most apposite example .The Senate of that State is elected , as the federal Senate will be , indirectly by the people , and for a term less by one year only than the federal Senate .
It is distinguished , also , by the remarkable prerogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its appointment , and , at the same time , is not under the control of any such rotation as is provided for the federal Senate .There are some other lesser distinctions , which would expose the former to colorable objections , that do not lie against the latter .If the federal Senate , therefore , really contained the danger which has been so loudly proclaimed , some symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time to have been betrayed by the Senate of Maryland , but no such symptoms have appeared .On the contrary , the jealousies at first entertained by men of the same description with those who view with terror the correspondent part of the federal Constitution , have been gradually extinguished by the progress of the experiment ; and the Maryland constitution is daily deriving , from the salutary operation of this part of it , a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of any State in the Union .But if any thing could silence the jealousies on this subject , it ought to be the British example .The Senate there instead of being elected for a term of six years , and of being unconfined to particular families or fortunes , is an hereditary assembly of opulent nobles .
The House of Representatives , instead of being elected for two years , and by the whole body of the people , is elected for seven years , and , in very great proportion , by a very small proportion of the people .Here , unquestionably , ought to be seen in full display the aristocratic usurpations and tyranny which are at some future period to be exemplified in the United States .Unfortunately , however , for the anti-federal argument , the British history informs us that this hereditary assembly has not been able to defend itself against the continual encroachments of the House of Representatives ; and that it no sooner lost the support of the monarch , than it was actually crushed by the weight of the popular branch .As far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject , its examples support the reasoning which we have employed .In Sparta , the Ephori , the annual representatives of the people , were found an overmatch for the senate for life , continually gained on its authority and finally drew all power into their own hands .The Tribunes of Rome , who were the representatives of the people , prevailed , it is well known , in almost every contest with the senate for life , and in the end gained the most complete triumph over it .The fact is the more remarkable , as unanimity was required in every act of the Tribunes , even after their number was augmented to ten .
