There have been , if I may so express it , almost as many popular as royal wars .The cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have , upon various occasions , dragged their monarchs into war , or continued them in it , contrary to their inclinations , and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State .In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON , which so long kept Europe in a flame , it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the French , seconding the ambition , or rather the avarice , of a favorite leader,10 protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy , and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court .The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure grown out of commercial considerations , -- the desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted , either in particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and navigation .From this summary of what has taken place in other countries , whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own , what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy , in a state of separation ? Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections , weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape ?	0
They would , at the same time , be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government , in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy .It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority .The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors .Small states , or states of less natural strength , under vigorous governments , and with the assistance of disciplined armies , have often triumphed over large states , or states of greater natural strength , which have been destitute of these advantages .Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority .They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected , to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence .Thus , we should , in a little time , see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World .This , at least , would be the natural course of things ; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just , in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard .These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a Constitution , the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people , or their representatives and delegates , but they are solid conclusions , drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs .	0
Such a point gained from the British government , and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets , would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations , who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade .A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us , in this respect , would arise from the establishment of a federal navy .There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power , at a period not very distant , to create a navy which , if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers , would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties .This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies .A few ships of the line , sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side , would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign , on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended .Our position is , in this respect , a most commanding one .And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country , in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies , it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges .	0
A price would be set not only upon our friendship , but upon our neutrality .By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope , erelong , to become the arbiter of Europe in America , and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate .But in the reverse of this eligible situation , we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other , and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach .In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other ; who , having nothing to fear from us , would with little scruple or remorse , supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way .The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power .A nation , despicable by its weakness , forfeits even the privilege of being neutral .Under a vigorous national government , the natural strength and resources of the country , directed to a common interest , would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth .This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations , by inducing an impracticability of success .An active commerce , an extensive navigation , and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity .	0
The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue From the New York Packet .Tuesday , November 27 , 1787 .To the People of the State of New York : THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated .Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry .The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth , and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares .By multiplying the means of gratification , by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals , those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise , it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry , and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness .The assiduous merchant , the laborious husbandman , the active mechanic , and the industrious manufacturer , -- all orders of men , look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils .The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has , from indubitable experience , received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them , and has proved , to the satisfaction of their friends , that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven .It has been found in various countries that , in proportion as commerce has flourished , land has risen in value .	0
In so opulent a nation as that of Britain , where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable , and , from the vigor of the government , much more practicable , than in America , far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind , from imposts , and from excises .Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description .In America , it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties .In most parts of it , excises must be confined within a narrow compass .The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws .The pockets of the farmers , on the other hand , will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies , in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands ; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption .If these remarks have any foundation , that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare .And it can not admit of a serious doubt , that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general Union .	0
Hitherto , I believe , it may safely be asserted , that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent .In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent. , and in Britain they exceed this proportion.1 There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their present amount .The single article of ardent spirits , under federal regulation , might be made to furnish a considerable revenue .Upon a ratio to the importation into this State , the whole quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons ; which , at a shilling per gallon , would produce two hundred thousand pounds .That article would well bear this rate of duty ; and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it , such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture , to the economy , to the morals , and to the health of the society .There is , perhaps , nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these spirits .What will be the consequence , if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent ? A nation can not long exist without revenues .Destitute of this essential support , it must resign its independence , and sink into the degraded condition of a province .	0
In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of the subject , the point next in order to be examined is the `` insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation of the Union . ''It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted , to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent , and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new Constitution .It must in truth be acknowledged that , however these may differ in other respects , they in general appear to harmonize in this sentiment , at least , that there are material imperfections in our national system , and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy .The facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation .They have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large , and have at length extorted from those , whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived , a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of our federal government , which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union .We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation .	0
But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation ; if we still will adhere to the design of a national government , or , which is the same thing , of a superintending power , under the direction of a common council , we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government ; we must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the citizens , -- the only proper objects of government .Government implies the power of making laws .It is essential to the idea of a law , that it be attended with a sanction ; or , in other words , a penalty or punishment for disobedience .If there be no penalty annexed to disobedience , the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws will , in fact , amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation .This penalty , whatever it may be , can only be inflicted in two ways : by the agency of the courts and ministers of justice , or by military force ; by the COERCION of the magistracy , or by the COERCION of arms .The first kind can evidently apply only to men ; the last kind must of necessity , be employed against bodies politic , or communities , or States .It is evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance of the laws can , in the last resort , be enforced .	0
This would be the more likely to take place , as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers , with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement ; the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent States .If associates could not be found at home , recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers , who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy , from the firm union of which they had so much to fear .When the sword is once drawn , the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation .The suggestions of wounded pride , the instigations of irritated resentment , would be apt to carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted , to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of submission .The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union .This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy .Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing , if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form .It is not probable , considering the genius of this country , that the complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States .	0
There is , doubtless , a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist , but we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition , preposterous as it may seem , or of contravening or explaining away a provision , which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of those who oppose the new Constitution ; and the want of which , in that plan , has been the subject of much plausible animadversion , and severe criticism .If we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provision , we shall be obliged to conclude , that the United States afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws .It will appear , from the specimens which have been cited , that the American Confederacy , in this particular , stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind , and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world .The want of a mutual guaranty of the State governments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan .There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compose it ; and to imply a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility , would be a still more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned , than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations .	0
The want of a guaranty , though it might in its consequences endanger the Union , does not so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws .Without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the Union in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the existence of the State constitutions , must be renounced .Usurpation may rear its crest in each State , and trample upon the liberties of the people , while the national government could legally do nothing more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret .A successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law , while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union to the friends and supporters of the government .The tempestuous situation from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged , evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative .Who can determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions , if the malcontents had been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell ? Who can predict what effect a despotism , established in Massachusetts , would have upon the liberties of New Hampshire or Rhode Island , of Connecticut or New York ? The inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal government , as involving an officious interference in the domestic concerns of the members .	0
The Same Subject Continued ( Other Defects of the Present Confederation ) From the New York Packet .Friday , December 14 , 1787 .To the People of the State of New York : IN ADDITION to the defects already enumerated in the existing federal system , there are others of not less importance , which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of the Union .The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number .The utility of such a power has been anticipated under the first head of our inquiries ; and for this reason , as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon the subject , little need be added in this place .It is indeed evident , on the most superficial view , that there is no object , either as it respects the interests of trade or finance , that more strongly demands a federal superintendence .The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers , and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the States .No nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the United States , by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them , while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the Union might at any moment be violated by its members , and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets , without granting us any return but such as their momentary convenience might suggest .	0
The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the Preservation of the Union From the New York Packet .Tuesday , December 18 , 1787 .To the People of the State of New York : THE necessity of a Constitution , at least equally energetic with the one proposed , to the preservation of the Union , is the point at the examination of which we are now arrived .This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government , the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects , the persons upon whom that power ought to operate .Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head .The principal purposes to be answered by union are these the common defense of the members ; the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks ; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States ; the superintendence of our intercourse , political and commercial , with foreign countries .The authorities essential to the common defense are these : to raise armies ; to build and equip fleets ; to prescribe rules for the government of both ; to direct their operations ; to provide for their support .These powers ought to exist without limitation , BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR DEFINE THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF NATIONAL EXIGENCIES , OR THE CORRESPONDENT EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THE MEANS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THEM .	0
Defective as the present Confederation has been proved to be , this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers of it ; though they have not made proper or adequate provision for its exercise .Congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of men and money ; to govern the army and navy ; to direct their operations .As their requisitions are made constitutionally binding upon the States , who are in fact under the most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them , the intention evidently was that the United States should command whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the `` common defense and general welfare . ''It was presumed that a sense of their true interests , and a regard to the dictates of good faith , would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head .The experiment has , however , demonstrated that this expectation was ill-founded and illusory ; and the observations , made under the last head , will , I imagine , have sufficed to convince the impartial and discerning , that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system ; that if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy and duration , we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective capacities ; we must extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of America ; we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions , as equally impracticable and unjust .	0
The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered For the Independent Journal .To the People of the State of New York : To THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government , in respect to the creation and direction of the national forces , I have met with but one specific objection , which , if I understand it right , is this , that proper provision has not been made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace ; an objection which , I shall now endeavor to show , rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations .It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form , supported only by bold assertions , without the appearance of argument ; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions ; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations , and to the general sense of America , as expressed in most of the existing constitutions .The proprietory of this remark will appear , the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation , in the article of military establishments ; a principle unheard of , except in one or two of our State constitutions , and rejected in all the rest .A stranger to our politics , who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture , without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention , would be naturally led to one of two conclusions : either that it contained a positive injunction , that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace ; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops , without subjecting his discretion , in any shape , to the control of the legislature .	0
Here is a simple view of the subject , that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments , and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature .In proportion to our increase in strength , it is probable , nay , it may be said certain , that Britain and Spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood .If we should not be willing to be exposed , in a naked and defenseless condition , to their insults and encroachments , we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be annoyed .There are , and will be , particular posts , the possession of which will include the command of large districts of territory , and facilitate future invasions of the remainder .It may be added that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations .Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers ? To act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy .If we mean to be a commercial people , or even to be secure on our Atlantic side , we must endeavor , as soon as possible , to have a navy .	0
To this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals ; and for the defense of these , fortifications , and probably garrisons .When a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets , this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose ; but where naval establishments are in their infancy , moderate garrisons will , in all likelihood , be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards , and sometimes of the fleet itself .FNA1- @ 1 This statement of the matter is taken from the printed collection of State constitutions .Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the two which contain the interdiction in these words : `` As standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty , THEY OUGHT NOT to be kept up . ''This is , in truth , rather a CAUTION than a PROHIBITION .New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Delaware , and Maryland have , in each of their bils of rights , a clause to this effect : `` Standing armies are dangerous to liberty , and ought not to be raised or kept up WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE `` ; which is a formal admission of the authority of the Legislature .New York has no bills of rights , and her constitution says not a word about the matter .No bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions of the other States , except the foregoing , and their constitutions are equally silent .	0
There are other lights besides those already taken notice of , in which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the national legislature will be equally manifest .The design of the objection , which has been mentioned , is to preclude standing armies in time of peace , though we have never been informed how far it is designed the prohibition should extend ; whether to raising armies as well as to KEEPING THEM UP in a season of tranquillity or not .If it be confined to the latter it will have no precise signification , and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended .When armies are once raised what shall be denominated `` keeping them up , `` contrary to the sense of the Constitution ? What time shall be requisite to ascertain the violation ? Shall it be a week , a month , a year ? Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues ? This would be to admit that they might be kept up IN TIME OF PEACE , against threatening or impending danger , which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition , and to introduce an extensive latitude of construction .Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger ? This must undoubtedly be submitted to the national government , and the matter would then be brought to this issue , that the national government , to provide against apprehended danger , might in the first instance raise troops , and might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy .	0
It is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision .The supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be founded on the supposed probability , or at least possibility , of a combination between the executive and the legislative , in some scheme of usurpation .Should this at any time happen , how easy would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger ! Indian hostilities , instigated by Spain or Britain , would always be at hand .Provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be given to some foreign power , and appeased again by timely concessions .If we can reasonably presume such a combination to have been formed , and that the enterprise is warranted by a sufficient prospect of success , the army , when once raised , from whatever cause , or on whatever pretext , may be applied to the execution of the project .If , to obviate this consequence , it should be resolved to extend the prohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace , the United States would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the world has yet seen , that of a nation incapacitated by its Constitution to prepare for defense , before it was actually invaded .As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse , the presence of an enemy within our territories must be waited for , as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the State .	0
It also teaches us , in its application to the United States , how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be respected , even by its own constituents .And it teaches us , in addition to the rest , how unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity .It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedaemonian commonwealth , that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same person .The Peloponnesian confederates , having suffered a severe defeat at sea from the Athenians , demanded Lysander , who had before served with success in that capacity , to command the combined fleets .The Lacedaemonians , to gratify their allies , and yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions , had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing Lysander with the real power of admiral , under the nominal title of vice-admiral .This instance is selected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by domestic examples ; which is , that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the necessities of society .Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that can not be observed , because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws , though dictated by necessity , impairs that sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country , and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all , or is less urgent and palpable .	0
I call them unnecessary , because the reason which had introduced a similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not applicable to any of the State constitutions .The power of raising armies at all , under those constitutions , can by no construction be deemed to reside anywhere else , than in the legislatures themselves ; and it was superfluous , if not absurd , to declare that a matter should not be done without the consent of a body , which alone had the power of doing it .Accordingly , in some of these constitutions , and among others , in that of this State of New York , which has been justly celebrated , both in Europe and America , as one of the best of the forms of government established in this country , there is a total silence upon the subject .It is remarkable , that even in the two States which seem to have meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of peace , the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than prohibitory .It is not said , that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept up , but that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up , in time of peace .This ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict between jealousy and conviction ; between the desire of excluding such establishments at all events , and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe .	0
Can it be doubted that such a provision , whenever the situation of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it , would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition , and would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of the State ? Let the fact already mentioned , with respect to Pennsylvania , decide .What then ( it may be asked ) is the use of such a provision , if it cease to operate the moment there is an inclination to disregard it ? Let us examine whether there be any comparison , in point of efficacy , between the provision alluded to and that which is contained in the new Constitution , for restraining the appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two years .The former , by aiming at too much , is calculated to effect nothing ; the latter , by steering clear of an imprudent extreme , and by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the exigencies of the nation , will have a salutary and powerful operation .The legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED , by this provision , once at least in every two years , to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot ; to come to a new resolution on the point ; and to declare their sense of the matter , by a formal vote in the face of their constituents .	0
The more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow , the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion .One thing , at all events , must be evident , that a government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using force , than that species of league contend for by most of its opponents ; the authority of which should only operate upon the States in their political or collective capacities .It has been shown that in such a Confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but force ; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the government ; and that as often as these happen , they can only be redressed , if at all , by war and violence .The plan reported by the convention , by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several States , will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each , in the execution of its laws .It is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy , in the common apprehension , all distinction between the sources from which they might proceed ; and will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of each State , in addition to the influence on public opinion which will result from the important consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole Union .	0
It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system , that the State governments will , in all possible contingencies , afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority .Projects of usurpation can not be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men , as of the people at large .The legislatures will have better means of information .They can discover the danger at a distance ; and possessing all the organs of civil power , and the confidence of the people , they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition , in which they can combine all the resources of the community .They can readily communicate with each other in the different States , and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty .The great extent of the country is a further security .We have already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power .And it would have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils .If the federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one State , the distant States would have it in their power to make head with fresh forces .The advantages obtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in others ; and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself , its efforts would be renewed , and its resistance revive .	0
That of New Hampshire is to be marched to Georgia , of Georgia to New Hampshire , of New York to Kentucky , and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain .Nay , the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats .At one moment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of the people ; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles , to tame the republican contumacy of Massachusetts ; and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians .Do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths ? If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism , what need of the militia ? If there should be no army , whither would the militia , irritated by being called upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition , for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen , direct their course , but to the seat of the tyrants , who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project , to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of power , and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people ?	0
Thus circumstanced , a war breaks out .What would be the probable conduct of the government in such an emergency ? Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the success of requisitions , unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh resources , and urged by considerations of national danger , would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the State ? It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided ; and if it should be taken , it is evident that it would prove the destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety .To imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with , would be the extreme of infatuation .In the modern system of war , nations the most wealthy are obliged to have recourse to large loans .A country so little opulent as ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree .But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying ? The loans it might be able to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions .They would be made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors , with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums .	0
The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From the New York Packet .Tuesday , January 1 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : IN DISQUISITIONS of every kind , there are certain primary truths , or first principles , upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend .These contain an internal evidence which , antecedent to all reflection or combination , commands the assent of the mind .Where it produces not this effect , it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the organs of perception , or from the influence of some strong interest , or passion , or prejudice .Of this nature are the maxims in geometry , that `` the whole is greater than its part ; things equal to the same are equal to one another ; two straight lines can not enclose a space ; and all right angles are equal to each other . ''Of the same nature are these other maxims in ethics and politics , that there can not be an effect without a cause ; that the means ought to be proportioned to the end ; that every power ought to be commensurate with its object ; that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation .And there are other truths in the two latter sciences which , if they can not pretend to rank in the class of axioms , are yet such direct inferences from them , and so obvious in themselves , and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common-sense , that they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind , with a degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible .	0
The moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the federal government , we get into an unfathomable abyss , and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning .Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle , and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured .Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the Union , it is easy to imagine an endless train of possible dangers ; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity , we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution .I repeat here what I have observed in substance in another place , that all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government , not to the nature or extent of its powers .The State governments , by their original constitutions , are invested with complete sovereignty .In what does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter ? Doubtless in the manner of their formation , and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people .If the proposed construction of the federal government be found , upon an impartial examination of it , to be such as to afford , to a proper extent , the same species of security , all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be discarded .	0
It should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union is quite as probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights of the State governments .What side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict , must depend on the means which the contending parties could employ toward insuring success .As in republics strength is always on the side of the people , and as there are weighty reasons to induce a belief that the State governments will commonly possess most influence over them , the natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of the Union ; and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head , than by the federal head upon the members .But it is evident that all conjectures of this kind must be extremely vague and fallible : and that it is by far the safest course to lay them altogether aside , and to confine our attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the Constitution .Every thing beyond this must be left to the prudence and firmness of the people ; who , as they will hold the scales in their own hands , it is to be hoped , will always take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the general and the State governments .	0
The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From the Daily Advertiser .Thursday , January 3 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the Union to control them in the levies of money , because I am persuaded that the sense of the people , the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State governments , and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes , would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power ; yet I am willing here to allow , in its full extent , the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants .And making this concession , I affirm that ( with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports ) they would , under the plan of the convention , retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense ; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it , would be a violent assumption of power , unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution .	0
Whatever may have been the inducement to it , the wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raised against it ; as that very cry betrays a disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to declare .But it may be again asked , Who is to judge of the NECESSITY and PROPRIETY of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the Union ? I answer , first , that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory clause ; and I answer , in the second place , that the national government , like every other , must judge , in the first instance , of the proper exercise of its powers , and its constituents in the last .If the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers , the people , whose creature it is , must appeal to the standard they have formed , and take such measures to redress the injury done to the Constitution as the exigency may suggest and prudence justify .The propriety of a law , in a constitutional light , must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded .Suppose , by some forced constructions of its authority ( which , indeed , can not easily be imagined ) , the Federal legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State , would it not be evident that , in making such an attempt , it had exceeded its jurisdiction , and infringed upon that of the State ?	0
It would otherwise be a mere treaty , dependent on the good faith of the parties , and not a government , which is only another word for POLITICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY .But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers , but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies , will become the supreme law of the land .These will be merely acts of usurpation , and will deserve to be treated as such .Hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union , like the one we have just before considered , only declares a truth , which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal government .It will not , I presume , have escaped observation , that it EXPRESSLY confines this supremacy to laws made PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION ; which I mention merely as an instance of caution in the convention ; since that limitation would have been to be understood , though it had not been expressed .Though a law , therefore , laying a tax for the use of the United States would be supreme in its nature , and could not legally be opposed or controlled , yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of the State , ( unless upon imports and exports ) , would not be the supreme law of the land , but a usurpation of power not granted by the Constitution .	0
We shall discover that the former are altogether unlimited , and that the latter are circumscribed within very moderate bounds .In pursuing this inquiry , we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to the present period , but to look forward to remote futurity .Constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a calculation of existing exigencies , but upon a combination of these with the probable exigencies of ages , according to the natural and tried course of human affairs .Nothing , therefore , can be more fallacious than to infer the extent of any power , proper to be lodged in the national government , from an estimate of its immediate necessities .There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future contingencies as they may happen ; and as these are illimitable in their nature , it is impossible safely to limit that capacity .It is true , perhaps , that a computation might be made with sufficient accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite to discharge the subsisting engagements of the Union , and to maintain those establishments which , for some time to come , would suffice in time of peace .But would it be wise , or would it not rather be the extreme of folly , to stop at this point , and to leave the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community against future invasions of the public peace , by foreign war or domestic convulsions ?	0
Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the people , and who is dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors , should take care to inform himself of their dispositions and inclinations , and should be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct ? This dependence , and the necessity of being bound himself , and his posterity , by the laws to which he gives his assent , are the true , and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the constituent .There is no part of the administration of government that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy , so much as the business of taxation .The man who understands those principles best will be least likely to resort to oppressive expedients , or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to the procurement of revenue .It might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always be the least burdensome .There can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation , it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general genius , habits , and modes of thinking of the people at large , and with the resources of the country .And this is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the people .	0
The violation of principle , in this case , would have required no comment ; and , to an unbiased observer , it will not be less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the national government , in a similar respect , to the pleasure of the State governments .An impartial view of the matter can not fail to result in a conviction , that each , as far as possible , ought to depend on itself for its own preservation .As an objection to this position , it may be remarked that the constitution of the national Senate would involve , in its full extent , the danger which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the State legislatures to regulate the federal elections .It may be alleged , that by declining the appointment of Senators , they might at any time give a fatal blow to the Union ; and from this it may be inferred , that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point , there can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under consideration .The interest of each State , it may be added , to maintain its representation in the national councils , would be a complete security against an abuse of the trust .This argument , though specious , will not , upon examination , be found solid .	0
But with regard to the federal House of Representatives , there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years .If the State legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections , every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national situation , which might issue in a dissolution of the Union , if the leaders of a few of the most important States should have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an election .I shall not deny , that there is a degree of weight in the observation , that the interests of each State , to be represented in the federal councils , will be a security against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of the State legislatures .But the security will not be considered as complete , by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between the interest of the people in the public felicity , and the interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of their offices .The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the Union , at times when the particular rulers of particular States , stimulated by the natural rivalship of power , and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement , and supported by a strong faction in each of those States , may be in a very opposite temper .	0
The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members ) From the New York Packet .Tuesday , February 26 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : WE HAVE seen , that an uncontrollable power over the elections to the federal government could not , without hazard , be committed to the State legislatures .Let us now see , what would be the danger on the other side ; that is , from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the Union itself .It is not pretended , that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of any State from its share in the representation .The interest of all would , in this respect at least , be the security of all .But it is alleged , that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others , by confining the places of election to particular districts , and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in the choice .Of all chimerical suppositions , this seems to be the most chimerical .On the one hand , no rational calculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply , could ever find its way into the national councils ; and on the other , it may be concluded with certainty , that if so improper a spirit should ever gain admittance into them , it would display itself in a form altogether different and far more decisive .	0
The improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred from this single reflection , that it could never be made without causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people , headed and directed by the State governments .It is not difficult to conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may , in certain turbulent and factious seasons , be violated , in respect to a particular class of citizens , by a victorious and overbearing majority ; but that so fundamental a privilege , in a country so situated and enlightened , should be invaded to the prejudice of the great mass of the people , by the deliberate policy of the government , without occasioning a popular revolution , is altogether inconceivable and incredible .In addition to this general reflection , there are considerations of a more precise nature , which forbid all apprehension on the subject .The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national government , and still more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches , must form a powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of elections .There is sufficient diversity in the state of property , in the genius , manners , and habits of the people of the different parts of the Union , to occasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions in society .	0
If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only , would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions , they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm , from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections , than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect .A review of their situation , in this particular , would tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this matter .But as that view would lead into long and tedious details , I shall content myself with the single example of the State in which I write .The constitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of elections , than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in the COUNTIES ; those of the Senate , in the great districts into which the State is or may be divided : these at present are four in number , and comprehend each from two to six counties .It may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York , by confining elections to particular places , than for the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the Union , by the like expedient .Suppose , for instance , the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part , would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district ?	0
Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany , Saratoga , Cambridge , etc. , or in any part of the county of Montgomery , would take the trouble to come to the city of Albany , to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate , sooner than they would repair to the city of New York , to participate in the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives ? The alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws , which afford every facility to it , furnishes a ready answer to this question .And , abstracted from any experience on the subject , we can be at no loss to determine , that when the place of election is at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector , the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles .Hence it must appear , that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will , in substance , apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this State ; and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one , and to condemn the other .A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other States .	0
The mass would be likely to remain nearly the same , assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions .There is a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind to resist .I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office , with the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time , might be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and successive alterations .Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate , and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each year .It may be asked , Why , then , could not a time have been fixed in the Constitution ? As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention in this State are , in general , not less zealous admirers of the constitution of the State , the question may be retorted , and it may be asked , Why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the constitution of this State ? No better answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion ; and that if a time had been appointed , it might , upon experiment , have been found less convenient than some other time .The same answer may be given to the question put on the other side .	0
The awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have , to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community , forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons .These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion , that the Supreme Court would have been an improper substitute for the Senate , as a court of impeachments .There remains a further consideration , which will not a little strengthen this conclusion .It is this : The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment , is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender .After having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence , and honors and emoluments of his country , he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law .Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame , and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial , should , in another trial , for the same offense , be also the disposers of his life and his fortune ? Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend , that error , in the first sentence , would be the parent of error in the second sentence ? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision ?	0
Objections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for Impeachments Further Considered From the New York Packet .Tuesday , March 11 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared against the proposed court for the trial of impeachments , will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still exist in regard to this matter .The FIRST of these objections is , that the provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body , in violation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires a separation between the different departments of power .The true meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place , and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of those departments for special purposes , preserving them , in the main , distinct and unconnected .This partial intermixture is even , in some cases , not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the several members of the government against each other .An absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative body , is admitted , by the ablest adepts in political science , to be an indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the former .And it may , perhaps , with no less reason be contended , that the powers relating to impeachments are , as before intimated , an essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive .	0
The Executive Department From the New York Packet .Tuesday , March 11 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THE constitution of the executive department of the proposed government , claims next our attention .There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this ; and there is , perhaps , none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment .Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation .Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy , they have endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended President of the United States ; not merely as the embryo , but as the full-grown progeny , of that detested parent .To establish the pretended affinity , they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction .The authorities of a magistrate , in few instances greater , in some instances less , than those of a governor of New York , have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives .He has been decorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain .He has been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his train .	0
It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of Great Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the President of the United States .It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition .In one instance , which I cite as a sample of the general spirit , the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of the United States a power which by the instrument reported is EXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States .I mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the Senate .This bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been hazarded by a writer who ( whatever may be his real merit ) has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party1 ; and who , upon this false and unfounded suggestion , has built a series of observations equally false and unfounded .Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact , and let him , if he be able , justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing .The second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the President of the United States `` to nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other OFFICERS of United States whose appointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR , and WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW . ``	0
A small number of persons , selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass , will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations .It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder .This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate , who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States .But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration , promise an effectual security against this mischief .The choice of SEVERAL , to form an intermediate body of electors , will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements , than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes .And as the electors , chosen in each State , are to assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen , this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments , which might be communicated from them to the people , than if they were all to be convened at one time , in one place .Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal , intrigue , and corruption .These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter , but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils .	0
There can be no need , however , to multiply arguments or examples on this head .A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government .A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution ; and a government ill executed , whatever it may be in theory , must be , in practice , a bad government .Taking it for granted , therefore , that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive , it will only remain to inquire , what are the ingredients which constitute this energy ? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense ? And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention ? The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are , first , unity ; secondly , duration ; thirdly , an adequate provision for its support ; fourthly , competent powers .The ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense are , first , a due dependence on the people , secondly , a due responsibility .Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views , have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature .They have with great propriety , considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former , and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand , while they have , with equal propriety , considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom , and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests .	0
If no such cabal should exist , the mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness .But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive , and which lies as much against the last as the first plan , is , that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility .Responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment .The first is the more important of the two , especially in an elective office .Man , in public trust , will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted , than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment .But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case .It often becomes impossible , amidst mutual accusations , to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure , or series of pernicious measures , ought really to fall .It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity , and under such plausible appearances , that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author .The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that , where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency , though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement , yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable .	0
`` I was overruled by my council .The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point . ''These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand , whether true or false .And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium , of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction ? Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task , if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned , how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity , as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties ? In the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled with a council that is , in the appointment to offices , we have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration .Scandalous appointments to important offices have been made .Some cases , indeed , have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety of the thing .When inquiry has been made , the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council , who , on their part , have charged it upon his nomination ; while the people remain altogether at a loss to determine , by whose influence their interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper .	0
He is the absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office , and may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole discretion .But in a republic , where every magistrate ought to be personally responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British Constitution dictates the propriety of a council , not only ceases to apply , but turns against the institution .In the monarchy of Great Britain , it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of the chief magistrate , which serves in some degree as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior .In the American republic , it would serve to destroy , or would greatly diminish , the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself .The idea of a council to the Executive , which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions , has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man .If the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case , I should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side .But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power .I clearly concur in opinion , in this particular , with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be `` deep , solid , and ingenious , `` that `` the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE `` ; 2 that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people ; and , in a word , that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty .	0
A council to a magistrate , who is himself responsible for what he does , are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions , are often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to his faults .I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense ; though it be evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal end aimed at by the institution , the salaries of the members , who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government , would form an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal utility .I will only add that , prior to the appearance of the Constitution , I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the States , who did not admit , as the result of experience , that the UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution .1 New York has no council except for the single purpose of appointing to offices ; New Jersey has a council whom the governor may consult .But I think , from the terms of the constitution , their resolutions do not bind him .2 De Lolme .3 Ten . * There are two slightly different versions of No .70 included here .	0
There can be no need , however , to multiply arguments or examples on this head .A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government .A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution ; and a government ill executed , whatever it may be in theory , must be , in practice , a bad government .Taking it for granted , therefore , that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive , it will only remain to inquire , what are the ingredients which constitute this energy ? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense ? And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention ? The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are , first , unity ; secondly , duration ; thirdly , an adequate provision for its support ; fourthly , competent powers .The ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense are , first , a due dependence on the people , secondly , a due responsibility .Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views , have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature .They have with great propriety , considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former , and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand , while they have , with equal propriety , considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom , and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests .	0
We have seen that the Achaeans , on an experiment of two Praetors , were induced to abolish one .The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls , and between the military Tribunes , who were at times substituted for the Consuls .But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates .That the dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal , is a matter of astonishment , until we advert to the singular position in which the republic was almost continually placed , and to the prudent policy pointed out by the circumstances of the state , and pursued by the Consuls , of making a division of the government between them .The patricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of their ancient authorities and dignities ; the Consuls , who were generally chosen out of the former body , were commonly united by the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their order .In addition to this motive of union , after the arms of the republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire , it became an established custom with the Consuls to divide the administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs , the other taking the command in the more distant provinces .	0
This expedient must , no doubt , have had great influence in preventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the republic .But quitting the dim light of historical research , attaching ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good se se , we shall discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the Executive , under any modification whatever .Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit , there is always danger of difference of opinion .If it be a public trust or office , in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority , there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity .From either , and especially from all these causes , the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring .Whenever these happen , they lessen the respectability , weaken the authority , and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide .If they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country , consisting of a plurality of persons , they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government , in the most critical emergencies of the state .And what is still worse , they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions , adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy .Men often oppose a thing , merely because they have had no agency in planning it , or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike .	0
But if they have been consulted , and have happened to disapprove , opposition then becomes , in their estimation , an indispensable duty of self-love .They seem to think themselves bound in honor , and by all the motives of personal infallibility , to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments .Men of upright , benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking , with horror , to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried , and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity , to the conceit , and to the obstinacy of individuals , who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind .Perhaps the question now before the public may , in its consequences , afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty , or rather detestable vice , in the human character .Upon the principles of a free government , inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature ; but it is unnecessary , and therefore unwise , to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive .It is here too that they may be most pernicious .In the legislature , promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit .The differences of opinion , and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government , though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans , yet often promote deliberation and circumspection , and serve to check excesses in the majority .	0
If the case should only be , that he MIGHT lay it down , unless continued by a new choice , and if he should be desirous of being continued , his wishes , conspiring with his fears , would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity , or debase his fortitude .In either case , feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station .There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current , either in the community or in the legislature , as its best recommendation .But such men entertain very crude notions , as well of the purposes for which government was instituted , as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted .The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs ; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion , or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men , who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests .It is a just observation , that the people commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD .This often applies to their very errors .But their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting it .	0
An ambitious man , too , when he found himself seated on the summit of his country 's honors , when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever , and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse ; such a man , in such a situation , would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power , at every personal hazard , than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty .Would it promote the peace of the community , or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy , wandering among the people like discontented ghosts , and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess ? A third ill effect of the exclusion would be , the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office .That experience is the parent of wisdom , is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind .What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations ? Where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation ?	0
A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be , that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration .By NECESSITATING a change of men , in the first office of the nation , it would necessitate a mutability of measures .It is not generally to be expected , that men will vary and measures remain uniform .The contrary is the usual course of things .And we need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability , while there is even the option of changing ; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they think it may be safely placed , and where , by constancy on their part , they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy .These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle of exclusion .They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual exclusion ; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object , the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other .What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages ? They are represented to be : 1st , greater independence in the magistrate ; 2d , greater security to the people .Unless the exclusion be perpetual , there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage .	0
And in the one mode or the other , the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands .If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive , the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us , that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other , but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of selfdefense .But the power in question has a further use .It not only serves as a shield to the Executive , but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws .It establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body , calculated to guard the community against the effects of faction , precipitancy , or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good , which may happen to influence a majority of that body .The propriety of a negative has , upon some occasions , been combated by an observation , that it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men ; and that unless this presumption should be entertained , it would be improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body .But this observation , when examined , will appear rather specious than solid .The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive , but upon the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible ; that the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of other members of the government ; that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations ; that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself , on maturer reflexion , would condemn .	0
In proportion as it would be less apt to offend , it would be more apt to be exercised ; and for this very reason , it may in practice be found more effectual .It is to be hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time ; and this , too , in spite of the counterposing weight of the Executive .It is at any rate far less probable that this should be the case , than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority .A power of this nature in the Executive , will often have a silent and unperceived , though forcible , operation .When men , engaged in unjustifiable pursuits , are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they can not control , they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition , from doing what they would with eagerness rush into , if no such external impediments were to be feared .This qualified negative , as has been elsewhere remarked , is in this State vested in a council , consisting of the governor , with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court , or any two of them .It has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions , and frequently with success .	0
This I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan , as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office .He is also to be authorized to grant `` reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , EXCEPT IN CASES OF IMPEACHMENT . ''Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate , that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed .The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity , that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt , justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel .As the sense of responsibility is always strongest , in proportion as it is undivided , it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law , and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance .The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat , would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution ; the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance , would beget equal circumspection , though of a different kind .On the other hand , as men generally derive confidence from their numbers , they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy , and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency .	0
In every such case , we might expect to see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense .And when parties were pretty equally matched , the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person , availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of others , might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary .On the other hand , when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party , they might often be found obstinate and inexorable , when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency .But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the Chief Magistrate is this : in seasons of insurrection or rebellion , there are often critical moments , when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth ; and which , if suffered to pass unimproved , it may never be possible afterwards to recall .The dilatory process of convening the legislature , or one of its branches , for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure , would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity .The loss of a week , a day , an hour , may sometimes be fatal .If it should be observed , that a discretionary power , with a view to such contingencies , might be occasionally conferred upon the President , it may be answered in the first place , that it is questionable , whether , in a limited Constitution , that power could be delegated by law ; and in the second place , that it would generally be impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity .	0
With regard to the intermixture of powers , I shall rely upon the explanations already given in other places , of the true sense of the rule upon which that objection is founded ; and shall take it for granted , as an inference from them , that the union of the Executive with the Senate , in the article of treaties , is no infringement of that rule .I venture to add , that the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union .Though several writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of executive authorities , yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition ; for if we attend carefully to its operation , it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character , though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them .The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws , or , in other words , to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society ; while the execution of the laws , and the employment of the common strength , either for this purpose or for the common defense , seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate .The power of making treaties is , plainly , neither the one nor the other .It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws , nor to the enaction of new ones ; and still less to an exertion of the common strength .	0
It will be agreed on all hands , that the power of appointment , in ordinary cases , ought to be modified in one of three ways .It ought either to be vested in a single man , or in a SELECT assembly of a moderate number ; or in a single man , with the concurrence of such an assembly .The exercise of it by the people at large will be readily admitted to be impracticable ; as waiving every other consideration , it would leave them little time to do anything else .When , therefore , mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of men , what is said must be understood to relate to a select body or assembly , of the description already given .The people collectively , from their number and from their dispersed situation , can not be regulated in their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and intrigue , which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men .Those who have themselves reflected upon the subject , or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of these papers , in relation to the appointment of the President , will , I presume , agree to the position , that there would always be great probability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities , at least respectable .	0
Premising this , I proceed to lay it down as a rule , that one man of discernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices , than a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment .The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation .He will , on this account , feel himself under stronger obligations , and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled , and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest pretensions to them .He will have FEWER personal attachments to gratify , than a body of men who may each be supposed to have an equal number ; and will be so much the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of affection .A single well-directed man , by a single understanding , can not be distracted and warped by that diversity of views , feelings , and interests , which frequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body .There is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether they relate to ourselves or to others , who are to be the objects of our choice or preference .Hence , in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices , by an assembly of men , we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes , partialities and antipathies , attachments and animosities , which are felt by those who compose the assembly .	0
The Appointing Power Continued and Other Powers of the Executive Considered From the New York Packet .Friday , April 4 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : IT HAS been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the Senate , in the business of appointments , that it would contribute to the stability of the administration .The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint .A change of the Chief Magistrate , therefore , would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected , if he were the sole disposer of offices .Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it , a new President would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him , by the apprehension that a discountenance of the Senate might frustrate the attempt , and bring some degree of discredit upon himself .Those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration , will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which , from the greater permanency of its own composition , will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government .	0
To this union of the Senate with the President , in the article of appointments , it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the President an undue influence over the Senate , and in others that it would have an opposite tendency , a strong proof that neither suggestion is true .To state the first in its proper form , is to refute it .It amounts to this : the President would have an improper INFLUENCE OVER the Senate , because the Senate would have the power of RESTRAINING him .This is an absurdity in terms .It can not admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body , than a mere power of nomination subject to their control .Let us take a view of the converse of the proposition : `` the Senate would influence the Executive . ''As I have had occasion to remark in several other instances , the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer .In what manner is this influence to be exerted ? In relation to what objects ? The power of influencing a person , in the sense in which it is here used , must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him .How could the Senate confer a benefit upon the President by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations ?	0
The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President singly and absolutely .The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the Senate ; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the Executive .If an ill appointment should be made , the Executive for nominating , and the Senate for approving , would participate , though in different degrees , in the opprobrium and disgrace .The reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this State .The council of appointment consists of from three to five persons , of whom the governor is always one .This small body , shut up in a private apartment , impenetrable to the public eye , proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them .It is known that the governor claims the right of nomination , upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution ; but it is not known to what extent , or in what manner he exercises it ; nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed .The censure of a bad appointment , on account of the uncertainty of its author , and for want of a determinate object , has neither poignancy nor duration .And while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open , all idea of responsibility is lost .The most that the public can know , is that the governor claims the right of nomination ; that TWO out of the inconsiderable number of FOUR men can too often be managed without much difficulty ; that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character , it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient ; and that from whatever cause it may proceed , a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made .	0
But with regard to the judges , who , if they behave properly , will be secured in their places for life , it may well happen , especially in the early stages of the government , that a stipend , which would be very sufficient at their first appointment , would become too small in the progress of their service .This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy ; and it may be safely affirmed that , together with the permanent tenure of their offices , it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges .The precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments .They are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the House of Representatives , and tried by the Senate ; and , if convicted , may be dismissed from office , and disqualified for holding any other .This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character , and is the only one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own judges .The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject of complaint .But all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose .	0
To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience .It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States .And though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance , yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes , that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against .Whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the States , are proper objects of federal superintendence and control .It may be esteemed the basis of the Union , that `` the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States . ''And if it be a just principle that every government OUGHT TO POSSESS THE MEANS OF EXECUTING ITS OWN PROVISIONS BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY , it will follow , that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be entitled , the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens .To secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge , it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal which , having no local attachments , will be likely to be impartial between the different States and their citizens , and which , owing its official existence to the Union , will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded .	0
These belong to the fourth of those classes , and partake , in some measure , of the nature of the last .Sixth .To cases between the citizens of the same State , CLAIMING LANDS UNDER GRANTS OF DIFFERENT STATES .These fall within the last class , and ARE THE ONLY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION DIRECTLY CONTEMPLATES THE COGNIZANCE OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF THE SAME STATE .Seventh .To cases between a State and the citizens thereof , and foreign States , citizens , or subjects .These have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated classes , and have been shown to be , in a peculiar manner , the proper subjects of the national judicature .From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary , as marked out in the Constitution , it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department , and which were necessary to the perfection of the system .If some partial inconviences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan , it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such EXCEPTIONS , and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences .The possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed , by a wellinformed mind , as a solid objection to a general principle , which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general advantages .	0
The theory , neither of the British , nor the State constitutions , authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act .Nor is there any thing in the proposed Constitution , more than in either of them , by which it is forbidden .In the former , as well as in the latter , the impropriety of the thing , on the general principles of law and reason , is the sole obstacle .A legislature , without exceeding its province , can not reverse a determination once made in a particular case ; though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases .This is the principle , and it applies in all its consequences , exactly in the same manner and extent , to the State governments , as to the national government now under consideration .Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject .It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority , which has been upon many occasions reiterated , is in reality a phantom .Particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen ; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience , or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system .This may be inferred with certainty , from the general nature of the judicial power , from the objects to which it relates , from the manner in which it is exercised , from its comparative weakness , and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force .	0
It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens of another , would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities ; a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation .It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual WITHOUT ITS CONSENT .This is the general sense , and the general practice of mankind ; and the exemption , as one of the attributes of sovereignty , is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union .Unless , therefore , there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention , it will remain with the States , and the danger intimated must be merely ideal .The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation , and need not be repeated here .A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us , that there is no color to pretend that the State governments would , by the adoption of that plan , be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way , free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith .The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign , and have no pretensions to a compulsive force .	0
Though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power , yet I am inclined to think that they are , in the main , just with respect to the former , as well as the latter .And under this impression , I shall lay it down as a rule , that the State courts will RETAIN the jurisdiction they now have , unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes .The only thing in the proposed Constitution , which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts , is contained in this passage : `` The JUDICIAL POWER of the United States SHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court , and in SUCH inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish . ''This might either be construed to signify , that the supreme and subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend ; or simply to denote , that the organs of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court , and as many subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint ; or in other words , that the United States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested , through one supreme tribunal , and a certain number of inferior ones , to be instituted by them .	0
From this circumstance , and from the reason of the thing , it ought to be construed to extend to the State tribunals .Either this must be the case , or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern , else the judiciary authority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor .Neither of these consequences ought , without evident necessity , to be involved ; the latter would be entirely inadmissible , as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government , and would essentially embarrass its measures .Nor do I perceive any foundation for such a supposition .Agreeably to the remark already made , the national and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE .The courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the Union , and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions .The evident aim of the plan of the convention is , that all the causes of the specified classes shall , for weighty public reasons , receive their original or final determination in the courts of the Union .To confine , therefore , the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court , to appeals from the subordinate federal courts , instead of allowing their extension to the State courts , would be to abridge the latitude of the terms , in subversion of the intent , contrary to every sound rule of interpretation .	0
The Judiciary Continued in Relation to Trial by Jury From MCLEAN 's Edition , New York .To the People of the State of New York : THE objection to the plan of the convention , which has met with most success in this State , and perhaps in several of the other States , is THAT RELATIVE TO THE WANT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION for the trial by jury in civil cases .The disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed , but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan .The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to CIVIL CAUSES , is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury , and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal , extending not only to every species of civil , but even to CRIMINAL CAUSES .To argue with respect to the latter would , however , be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the EXISTENCE of MATTER , or to demonstrate any of those propositions which , by their own internal evidence , force conviction , when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning .With regard to civil causes , subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only NOT PROVIDED FOR , is entirely ABOLISHED .	0
It would often occasion an accumulation of costs , more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied .And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue , the provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases , will afford the security aimed at .Wilful abuses of a public authority , to the oppression of the subject , and every species of official extortion , are offenses against the government , for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and punished according to the circumstances of the case .The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty .The strongest argument in its favor is , that it is a security against corruption .As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion , there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter .The force of this consideration is , however , diminished by others .The sheriff , who is the summoner of ordinary juries , and the clerks of courts , who have the nomination of special juries , are themselves standing officers , and , acting individually , may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges , who are a collective body .	0
Of this nature , among others , are all prize causes .Juries can not be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations ; and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries .There would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their decisions , so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war .Though the proper province of juries be to determine matters of fact , yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable .It will add great weight to this remark , in relation to prize causes , to mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe , and that , pursuant to such treaties , they are determinable in Great Britain , in the last resort , before the king himself , in his privy council , where the fact , as well as the law , undergoes a re-examination .This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution which would make the State systems a standard for the national government in the article under consideration , and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable .	0
This , at best , is a proposition confined to one description of causes ; and the inference is fair , either that the Massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal causes , in which the trial by jury would be proper ; or that if desirous of a more extensive provision , they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end .If the first , the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material imperfection in the system .If the last , it affords a strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing .But this is not all : if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union , and the different powers exercised by them , it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize THAT species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury .In this State , the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction , are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that subject .In many of the other States the boundaries are less precise .In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law , and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law , to be determined by a jury , if the parties , or either of them , choose it .	0
Hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition , that I have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority .In one State a cause would receive its determination from a jury , if the parties , or either of them , requested it ; but in another State , a cause exactly similar to the other , must be decided without the intervention of a jury , because the State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction .It is obvious , therefore , that the Massachusetts proposition , upon this subject can not operate as a general regulation , until some uniform plan , with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions , shall be adopted by the different States .To devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself , and which it would require much time and reflection to mature .It would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the States in the Union , or that would perfectly quadrate with the several State institutions .It may be asked , Why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this State , taking that , which is allowed by me to be a good one , as a standard for the United States ? I answer that it is not very probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves .	0
For this I believe , no precedent is to be found in any member of the Union ; and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of Pennsylvania , must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in ALL cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan .In short , the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose , or too much to be advisable ; or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government .I can not but persuade myself , on the other hand , that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations , will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point .They have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases , which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention ; that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases , and those in which the great body of the community is interested , that mode of trial will remain in its full force , as established in the State constitutions , untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention ; that it is in no case abolished3 by that plan ; and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a Constitution for the United States .	0
The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases , and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails .For my part , I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply , and might as advantageously be abridged in others .It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases .The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits , as well in these States as in Great Britain , afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient , and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions .I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop , and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature .This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain , and it is equally so in the State of Connecticut ; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution , though provided for by a positive article of our constitution , than has happened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain .	0
Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding , which are relative to personal and private concerns ? This we have seen has also been attended to , in a variety of cases , in the same plan .Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights , it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention .It may be said that it does not go far enough , though it will not be easy to make this appear ; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing .It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens , if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government .And hence it must be apparent , that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions , entirely foreign from the substance of the thing .Another objection which has been made , and which , from the frequency of its repetition , it is to be presumed is relied on , is of this nature : `` It is improper , `` say the objectors , `` to confer such large powers , as are proposed , upon the national government , because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent , of the conduct of the representative body . ``	0
I do not add the President , because there is now a president of Congress , whose expenses may not be far , if any thing , short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States .The support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense , but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter .But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence .Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government .The first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the President .Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him , according to general principles concerted with the Senate , and subject to their final concurrence .Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives ; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third , or perhaps half , for the former .The extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate .From this circumstance we may infer that , until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number , there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress .	0
Concluding Remarks From MCLEAN 's Edition , New York .To the People of the State of New York : ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers , announced in my first number , there would appear still to remain for discussion two points : `` the analogy of the proposed government to your own State constitution , `` and `` the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government , to liberty , and to property . ''But these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work , that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat , in a more dilated form , what has been heretofore said , which the advanced stage of the question , and the time already spent upon it , conspire to forbid .It is remarkable , that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which organizes the government of this State holds , not less with regard to many of the supposed defects , than to the real excellences of the former .Among the pretended defects are the re-eligibility of the Executive , the want of a council , the omission of a formal bill of rights , the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press .These and several others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing constitution of this State , as on the one proposed for the Union ; and a man must have slender pretensions to consistency , who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former .	0
Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us , who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live , than the fury with which they have attacked that plan , for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable .The additional securities to republican government , to liberty and to property , to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration , consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections , and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single States , who may acquire credit and influence enough , from leaders and favorites , to become the despots of the people ; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue , which the dissolution of the Confederacy would invite and facilitate ; in the prevention of extensive military establishments , which could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited situation ; in the express guaranty of a republican form of government to each ; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility ; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the State governments which have undermined the foundations of property and credit , have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens , and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals .	0
I can not resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this aspect .It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration , that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the Constitution .The moment an alteration is made in the present plan , it becomes , to the purpose of adoption , a new one , and must undergo a new decision of each State .To its complete establishment throughout the Union , it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States .If , on the contrary , the Constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the States as it stands , alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine States .Here , then , the chances are as thirteen to nine2 in favor of subsequent amendment , rather than of the original adoption of an entire system .This is not all .Every Constitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars , in which thirteen independent States are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest .We may of course expect to see , in any body of men charged with its original formation , very different combinations of the parts upon different points .Many of those who form a majority on one question , may become the minority on a second , and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third .	0
We may safely rely on the disposition of the State legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority .If the foregoing argument is a fallacy , certain it is that I am myself deceived by it , for it is , in my conception , one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration .Those who see the matter in the same light with me , however zealous they may be for amendments , must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption , as the most direct road to their own object .The zeal for attempts to amend , prior to the establishment of the Constitution , must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and ingenious : `` To balance a large state or society Usays hee , whether monarchical or republican , on general laws , is a work of so great difficulty , that no human genius , however comprehensive , is able , by the mere dint of reason and reflection , to effect it .The judgments of many must unite in the work ; experience must guide their labor ; time must bring it to perfection , and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they INEVITABLY fall into in their first trials and experiments . `` 3 These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the Union , and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy , civil war , a perpetual alienation of the States from each other , and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue , in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain , but from time and experience .	0
When a majority is included in a faction , the form of popular government , on the other hand , enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens .To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction , and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government , is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed .Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored , and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind .By what means is this object attainable ? Evidently by one of two only .Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented , or the majority , having such coexistent passion or interest , must be rendered , by their number and local situation , unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression .If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide , we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control .They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals , and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together , that is , in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful .	1
In some , it has been too evident from their own publications , that they have scanned the proposed Constitution , not only with a predisposition to censure , but with a predetermination to condemn ; as the language held by others betrays an opposite predetermination or bias , which must render their opinions also of little moment in the question .In placing , however , these different characters on a level , with respect to the weight of their opinions , I wish not to insinuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions .It is but just to remark in favor of the latter description , that as our situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical , and to require indispensably that something should be done for our relief , the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have taken his bias from the weight of these considerations , as well as from considerations of a sinister nature .The predetermined adversary , on the other hand , can have been governed by no venial motive whatever .The intentions of the first may be upright , as they may on the contrary be culpable .The views of the last can not be upright , and must be culpable .But the truth is , that these papers are not addressed to persons falling under either of these characters .They solicit the attention of those only , who add to a sincere zeal for the happiness of their country , a temper favorable to a just estimate of the means of promoting it .	1
An objector in a large State exclaims loudly against the unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate .An objector in a small State is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the House of Representatives .From this quarter , we are alarmed with the amazing expense , from the number of persons who are to administer the new government .From another quarter , and sometimes from the same quarter , on another occasion , the cry is that the Congress will be but a shadow of a representation , and that the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled .A patriot in a State that does not import or export , discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct taxation .The patriotic adversary in a State of great exports and imports , is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may be thrown on consumption .This politician discovers in the Constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy ; that is equally sure it will end in aristocracy .Another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume , but sees clearly it must be one or other of them ; whilst a fourth is not wanting , who with no less confidence affirms that the Constitution is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers , that the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite propensities .	1
With another class of adversaries to the Constitution the language is that the legislative , executive , and judiciary departments are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty .Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general expressions , there are but a few who lend their sanction to it .Let each one come forward with his particular explanation , and scarce any two are exactly agreed upon the subject .In the eyes of one the junction of the Senate with the President in the responsible function of appointing to offices , instead of vesting this executive power in the Executive alone , is the vicious part of the organization .To another , the exclusion of the House of Representatives , whose numbers alone could be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power , is equally obnoxious .With another , the admission of the President into any share of a power which ever must be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate , is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy .No part of the arrangement , according to some , is more inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the Senate , which is alternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments , when this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department .	1
Yet no blame has been whispered ; no alarm has been sounded .A GREAT and INDEPENDENT fund of revenue is passing into the hands of a SINGLE BODY of men , who can RAISE TROOPS to an INDEFINITE NUMBER , and appropriate money to their support for an INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME .And yet there are men , who have not only been silent spectators of this prospect , but who are advocates for the system which exhibits it ; and , at the same time , urge against the new system the objections which we have heard .Would they not act with more consistency , in urging the establishment of the latter , as no less necessary to guard the Union against the future powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing Congress , than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present impotency of that Assembly ? I mean not , by any thing here said , to throw censure on the measures which have been pursued by Congress .I am sensible they could not have done otherwise .The public interest , the necessity of the case , imposed upon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits .But is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular powers commensurate to its objects ? A dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed .	1
According to the constitution of every State in the Union , some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people .According to most of them , the chief magistrate himself is so appointed .And according to one , this mode of appointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legislature .According to all the constitutions , also , the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a definite period , and in many instances , both within the legislative and executive departments , to a period of years .According to the provisions of most of the constitutions , again , as well as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the subject , the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behavior .On comparing the Constitution planned by the convention with the standard here fixed , we perceive at once that it is , in the most rigid sense , conformable to it .The House of Representatives , like that of one branch at least of all the State legislatures , is elected immediately by the great body of the people .The Senate , like the present Congress , and the Senate of Maryland , derives its appointment indirectly from the people .The President is indirectly derived from the choice of the people , according to the example in most of the States .	1
It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the several States that are parties to it , differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed , not by the legislative authority , but by that of the people themselves .Were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation , the will of the majority of the whole people of the United States would bind the minority , in the same manner as the majority in each State must bind the minority ; and the will of the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual votes , or by considering the will of the majority of the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United States .Neither of these rules have been adopted .Each State , in ratifying the Constitution , is considered as a sovereign body , independent of all others , and only to be bound by its own voluntary act .In this relation , then , the new Constitution will , if established , be a FEDERAL , and not a NATIONAL constitution .The next relation is , to the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived .The House of Representatives will derive its powers from the people of America ; and the people will be represented in the same proportion , and on the same principle , as they are in the legislature of a particular State .	1
The other is , that where the several parts can not be made to coincide , the less important should give way to the more important part ; the means should be sacrificed to the end , rather than the end to the means .Suppose , then , that the expressions defining the authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with each other ; that a NATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could not possibly , in the judgment of the convention , be affected by ALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION ; which part of the definition ought to have been embraced , and which rejected ? Which was the more important , which the less important part ? Which the end ; which the means ? Let the most scrupulous expositors of delegated powers ; let the most inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention , answer these questions .Let them declare , whether it was of most importance to the happiness of the people of America , that the articles of Confederation should be disregarded , and an adequate government be provided , and the Union preserved ; or that an adequate government should be omitted , and the articles of Confederation preserved .Let them declare , whether the preservation of these articles was the end , for securing which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means ; or whether the establishment of a government , adequate to the national happiness , was the end at which these articles themselves originally aimed , and to which they ought , as insufficient means , to have been sacrificed .	1
It could not be unknown to them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of citizens , throughout this great empire , were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations .They had every reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States .They had seen in the origin and progress of the experiment , the alacrity with which the PROPOSITION , made by a single State ( Virginia ) , towards a partial amendment of the Confederation , had been attended to and promoted .They had seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW deputies from a VERY FEW States , convened at Annapolis , of recommending a great and critical object , wholly foreign to their commission , not only justified by the public opinion , but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen States .They had seen , in a variety of instances , assumptions by Congress , not only of recommendatory , but of operative , powers , warranted , in the public estimation , by occasions and objects infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed .They must have reflected , that in all great changes of established governments , forms ought to give way to substance ; that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former , would render nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people to `` abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness , `` 2 since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object ; and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some INFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS , made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens .	1
They were introduced by Charles VII .of France .All Europe has followed , or been forced into , the example .Had the example not been followed by other nations , all Europe must long ago have worn the chains of a universal monarch .Were every nation except France now to disband its peace establishments , the same event might follow .The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world .Not the less true is it , that the liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs ; and that the liberties of Europe , as far as they ever existed , have , with few exceptions , been the price of her military establishments .A standing force , therefore , is a dangerous , at the same time that it may be a necessary , provision .On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences .On an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal .On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution .A wise nation will combine all these considerations ; and , whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety , will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties .	1
But neither the common nor the statute law of that , or of any other nation , ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this , unless previously made its own by legislative adoption .The meaning of the term , as defined in the codes of the several States , would be as impracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide .It is not precisely the same in any two of the States ; and varies in each with every revision of its criminal laws .For the sake of certainty and uniformity , therefore , the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper .The regulation of foreign commerce , having fallen within several views which have been taken of this subject , has been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the federal administration .It were doubtless to be wished , that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808 , or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation .But it is not difficult to account , either for this restriction on the general government , or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed .It ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity , that a period of twenty years may terminate forever , within these States , a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy ; that within that period , it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government , and may be totally abolished , by a concurrence of the few States which continue the unnatural traffic , in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the Union .	1
Happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans , if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren ! Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the Constitution , by representing it on one side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice , and on another as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America .I mention these misconstructions , not with a view to give them an answer , for they deserve none , but as specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed government .The powers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the States .Under this head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the authority of the States , and certain powers of the judicial department ; but the former are reserved for a distinct class , and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and organization of the government .I shall confine myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third description , to wit : to regulate commerce among the several States and the Indian tribes ; to coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin ; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of the United States ; to fix the standard of weights and measures ; to establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws of bankruptcy , to prescribe the manner in which the public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved , and the effect they shall have in other States ; and to establish post offices and post roads .	1
The new Constitution has accordingly , with great propriety , made provision against them , and all others proceeding from the defect of the Confederation on this head , by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States .The power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce , and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different States , that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question .The power of prescribing by general laws , the manner in which the public acts , records and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved , and the effect they shall have in other States , is an evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of Confederation .The meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate , and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear .The power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice , and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States , where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated , in any stage of the process , within a foreign jurisdiction .The power of establishing post roads must , in every view , be a harmless power , and may , perhaps , by judicious management , become productive of great public conveniency .	1
Restrictions on the Authority of the Several States From the New York Packet .Friday , January 25 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : A FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the several States:1 . `` No State shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex-post-facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts ; or grant any title of nobility . `` The prohibition against treaties , alliances , and confederations makes a part of the existing articles of Union ; and for reasons which need no explanation , is copied into the new Constitution .The prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system , but is somewhat extended in the new .According to the former , letters of marque could be granted by the States after a declaration of war ; according to the latter , these licenses must be obtained , as well during war as previous to its declaration , from the government of the United States .This alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers ; and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible .	1
In addition to these persuasive considerations , it may be observed , that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin , prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin .Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin , there might be as many different currencies as States , and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded ; retrospective alterations in its value might be made , and thus the citizens of other States be injured , and animosities be kindled among the States themselves .The subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause , and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member .No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money , than to coin gold or silver .The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts , is withdrawn from the States , on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency .Bills of attainder , ex-post-facto laws , and laws impairing the obligation of contracts , are contrary to the first principles of the social compact , and to every principle of sound legislation .The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions , and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters .	1
If , to avoid this consequence , they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions , and described the residue by the general terms , NOT NECESSARY OR PROPER , it must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only ; that these would be such as would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated , because the enumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or proper ; and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum , would be less forcibly excepted , than if no partial enumeration had been made .Had the Constitution been silent on this head , there can be no doubt that all the particular powers requisite as means of executing the general powers would have resulted to the government , by unavoidable implication .No axiom is more clearly established in law , or in reason , than that wherever the end is required , the means are authorized ; wherever a general power to do a thing is given , every particular power necessary for doing it is included .Had this last method , therefore , been pursued by the convention , every objection now urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility ; and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the Union .	1
Was , then , the American Revolution effected , was the American Confederacy formed , was the precious blood of thousands spilt , and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished , not that the people of America should enjoy peace , liberty , and safety , but that the government of the individual States , that particular municipal establishments , might enjoy a certain extent of power , and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty ? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World , that the people were made for kings , not kings for the people .Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New , in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form ? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good , the real welfare of the great body of the people , is the supreme object to be pursued ; and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object .Were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness , my voice would be , Reject the plan .Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public happiness , it would be , Abolish the Union .In like manner , as far as the sovereignty of the States can not be reconciled to the happiness of the people , the voice of every good citizen must be , Let the former be sacrificed to the latter .	1
How far the sacrifice is necessary , has been shown .How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered , is the question before us .Several important considerations have been touched in the course of these papers , which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the State governments .The more I revolve the subject , the more fully I am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale .We have seen , in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies , the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members , to despoil the general government of its authorities , with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the encroachments .Although , in most of these examples , the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the former , yet , as the States will retain , under the proposed Constitution , a very extensive portion of active sovereignty , the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded .In the Achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of power , which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention .The Lycian Confederacy , as far as its principles and form are transmitted , must have borne a still greater analogy to it .	1
It is true , that the Confederacy is to possess , and may exercise , the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the States ; but it is probable that this power will not be resorted to , except for supplemental purposes of revenue ; that an option will then be given to the States to supply their quotas by previous collections of their own ; and that the eventual collection , under the immediate authority of the Union , will generally be made by the officers , and according to the rules , appointed by the several States .Indeed it is extremely probable , that in other instances , particularly in the organization of the judicial power , the officers of the States will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union .Should it happen , however , that separate collectors of internal revenue should be appointed under the federal government , the influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of State officers in the opposite scale .Within every district to which a federal collector would be allotted , there would not be less than thirty or forty , or even more , officers of different descriptions , and many of them persons of character and weight , whose influence would lie on the side of the State .The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined .	1
Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite .The former will be exercised principally on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign commerce ; with which last the power of taxation will , for the most part , be connected .The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which , in the ordinary course of affairs , concern the lives , liberties , and properties of the people , and the internal order , improvement , and prosperity of the State .The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger ; those of the State governments , in times of peace and security .As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter , the State governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government .The more adequate , indeed , the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense , the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular States .If the new Constitution be examined with accuracy and candor , it will be found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of NEW POWERS to the Union , than in the invigoration of its ORIGINAL POWERS .The regulation of commerce , it is true , is a new power ; but that seems to be an addition which few oppose , and from which no apprehensions are entertained .	1
It was engaged , too , in a course of measures which had for their object the protection of everything that was dear , and the acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people at large .It was , nevertheless , invariably found , after the transient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over , that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular governments ; that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor ; and that opposition to proposed enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence on the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens .If , therefore , as has been elsewhere remarked , the people should in future become more partial to the federal than to the State governments , the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs of a better administration , as will overcome all their antecedent propensities .And in that case , the people ought not surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover it to be most due ; but even in that case the State governments could have little to apprehend , because it is only within a certain sphere that the federal power can , in the nature of things , be advantageously administered .The remaining points on which I propose to compare the federal and State governments , are the disposition and the faculty they may respectively possess , to resist and frustrate the measures of each other .	1
The only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the State governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition .The reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed , if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger .That the people and the States should , for a sufficient period of time , elect an uninterrupted succession of men ready to betray both ; that the traitors should , throughout this period , uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment ; that the governments and the people of the States should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm , and continue to supply the materials , until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads , must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy , or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal , than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism .Extravagant as the supposition is , let it however be made .Let a regular army , fully equal to the resources of the country , be formed ; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government ; still it would not be going too far to say , that the State governments , with the people on their side , would be able to repel the danger .	1
The highest number to which , according to the best computation , a standing army can be carried in any country , does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls ; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms .This proportion would not yield , in the United States , an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men .To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands , officered by men chosen from among themselves , fighting for their common liberties , and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence .It may well be doubted , whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops .Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms , will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it .Besides the advantage of being armed , which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation , the existence of subordinate governments , to which the people are attached , and by which the militia officers are appointed , forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition , more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of .Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe , which are carried as far as the public resources will bear , the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms .	1
It declares `` that the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers , or either of them ; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers , or either of them ; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers , or either of them. `` This declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of Montesquieu , as it has been explained , and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the convention .It goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers of another department .In the very Constitution to which it is prefixed , a partial mixture of powers has been admitted .The executive magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body , and the Senate , which is a part of the legislature , is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments .The members of the judiciary department , again , are appointable by the executive department , and removable by the same authority on the address of the two legislative branches .Lastly , a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legislative department .As the appointment to offices , particularly executive offices , is in its nature an executive function , the compilers of the Constitution have , in this last point at least , violated the rule established by themselves .	1
In a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary monarch , the executive department is very justly regarded as the source of danger , and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire .In a democracy , where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative functions , and are continually exposed , by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted measures , to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates , tyranny may well be apprehended , on some favorable emergency , to start up in the same quarter .But in a representative republic , where the executive magistracy is carefully limited ; both in the extent and the duration of its power ; and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly , which is inspired , by a supposed influence over the people , with an intrepid confidence in its own strength ; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude , yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions , by means which reason prescribes ; it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions .The legislative department derives a superiority in our governments from other circumstances .Its constitutional powers being at once more extensive , and less susceptible of precise limits , it can , with the greater facility , mask , under complicated and indirect measures , the encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments .	1
This advantage must be increased by the consciousness , felt by the same side of being supported in its demands by right , by reason , and by the Constitution ; and the consciousness , on the opposite side , of contending against the force of all these solemn considerations .It is farther to be considered , that in the gradation between the smallest and largest States , there are several , which , though most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former are too little removed in extent and population from the latter , to second an opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions .Hence it is by no means certain that a majority of votes , even in the Senate , would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of representatives .It will not be looking too far to add , that the senators from all the new States may be gained over to the just views of the House of Representatives , by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked .As these States will , for a great length of time , advance in population with peculiar rapidity , they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the representatives to the number of inhabitants .The large States , therefore , who will prevail in the House of Representatives , will have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations mutually conditions of each other ; and the senators from all the most growing States will be bound to contend for the latter , by the interest which their States will feel in the former .	1
